1
00:02:55,695 --> 00:02:58,191
I'm kinda lonesome back here.

2
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:05,981
- Little help...
- Just... I have to keep my hands on the wheel.

3
00:03:07,051 --> 00:03:08,049
Excuse me!

4
00:03:10,669 --> 00:03:13,165
- Dopinder.
- Pool. Dead.

5
00:03:15,663 --> 00:03:18,536
- Nice!
- Smells good, no?

6
00:03:18,611 --> 00:03:20,409
Not the daffodil daydream. The girl.

7
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:24,104
Yes. Gita. She is quite lovely.

8
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,999
She would have made me
a very agreeable wife. But...

9
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:31,894
Gita's heart has been
stolen by my cousin, Bandu.

10
00:03:32,094 --> 00:03:36,488
He is as dishonorable
as he is attractive.

11
00:03:37,087 --> 00:03:41,481
Dopinder, I'm starting to think there's
a reason I'm in this cab today.

12
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:45,575
- Yes, sir, you called for it, remember?
- No, my slender, brown friend. Love...

13
00:03:46,075 --> 00:03:51,568
... is a beautiful thing. When you find it,
the whole world tastes like daffodil daydream.

14
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:55,362
So you gotta hold on to love. Tight!

15
00:03:55,562 --> 00:03:59,557
And never let go. Don't make the
same mistakes I did, got it?

16
00:03:59,856 --> 00:04:03,651
Or else the whole world tastes
like Mama June after hot yoga.

17
00:04:04,051 --> 00:04:06,448
Sir, what does Ms Mama June taste like?

18
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:12,539
Like two hobos fucking in a shoe filled with piss.
I can go all day, Dopinder. The point is it's bad.

19
00:04:14,037 --> 00:04:16,834
Why the fancy red suit, Mr. Pool?

20
00:04:17,033 --> 00:04:21,428
Oh, that's because it's Christmas day, Dopinder,
and I'm after someone on my naughty list.

21
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:28,518
I've been waiting, 1 year, 3 weeks, 6 days and---
14 minutes to make him fix what he did to me.

22
00:04:28,591 --> 00:04:32,586
- And what did he do to you, Mr. Pool?
- This shit.

23
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:35,482
Boo!

24
00:04:55,554 --> 00:04:59,549
- They won't disappoint.
- They'd better not!

25
00:04:59,648 --> 00:05:02,944
- What about next month's shipment?
- There won't be one.

26
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:06,010
You're not the only
one with a war to win.

27
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,736
That won't do.

28
00:05:10,534 --> 00:05:15,227
See, we've had this small
disruption to our supply trade.

29
00:05:18,578 --> 00:05:22,572
We'd appreciate your patience.

30
00:05:23,571 --> 00:05:25,169
Okay...

31
00:05:25,196 --> 00:05:27,094
We'll deliver in full
the following month.

32
00:05:30,986 --> 00:05:32,984
Pleasure doing business with you.

33
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,977
Fucking mutant!

34
00:05:47,964 --> 00:05:50,960
Shit! I forgot my ammo bag!

35
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:55,454
- Shall we turn back?
- No time. Fuck it. I got this.

36
00:05:55,653 --> 00:05:59,948
9, 10, 11, 12 bullets.
Or bust. Right here!

37
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:04,342
That's $27.50.

38
00:06:04,542 --> 00:06:08,436
I never carry a wallet while I'm
working. Ruins the lines of my suit.

39
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,605
- But how 'bout a crisp high-five?
- Okay.

40
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:13,020
Merry Christmas!

41
00:06:13,555 --> 00:06:16,650
And a convivial Tuesday
and April to you, Pool!

42
00:06:36,831 --> 00:06:39,628
Oh! Oh, hello!

43
00:06:39,827 --> 00:06:45,820
I know, right? Whose balls did I
have to fondle to get my very own movie?

44
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,713
I can't tell you, but it does rhyme
with "Pulverine". And lemme tell you...

45
00:06:50,913 --> 00:06:54,807
He's got a nice pair of
smooth criminals down under!

46
00:06:55,107 --> 00:06:58,852
Anyway. I got places to be.
A face to fix. And, oh!

47
00:06:58,902 --> 00:07:01,099
Bad guys to kill.

48
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:08,789
Maximum effort.

49
00:07:17,776 --> 00:07:19,374
Cock shot!

50
00:07:26,765 --> 00:07:29,760
Rich! Corinthian leather!

51
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:33,356
I'm looking for Francis!

52
00:07:33,556 --> 00:07:35,453
Have you seen this man?

53
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,238
Yanking, yanking!

54
00:08:18,695 --> 00:08:21,392
I've never said this, but don't swallow.

55
00:08:42,662 --> 00:08:46,257
Shit. Did I leave the stove on?

56
00:09:03,534 --> 00:09:05,432
Now, breaking news.

57
00:09:05,631 --> 00:09:09,626
A multi-car collision turned shots fired
on the crosstown expressway this morning.

58
00:09:09,726 --> 00:09:14,320
Gridlock has kept police from the scene.
Residents are advised to remain in their homes.

59
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,616
The assailant appears to be
armed, dangerous, and wearing a...

60
00:09:17,715 --> 00:09:20,611
Red suit. Deadpool.

61
00:09:20,711 --> 00:09:23,807
Negasonic! Come. We have mission.

62
00:09:24,007 --> 00:09:26,503
Colossus, wait up.

63
00:09:26,604 --> 00:09:30,099
I've given Deadpool
every chance to join us.

64
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:35,092
But he'd rather act like
a child. A heavily armed child.

65
00:09:35,292 --> 00:09:38,987
When will he grow up and see
benefits of becoming X-Man?

66
00:09:39,186 --> 00:09:43,282
Which benefits, the matching unitards?
The house that blows up every few years?

67
00:09:43,581 --> 00:09:46,576
Please. House blowing up builds character.

68
00:09:46,676 --> 00:09:51,970
You ate breakfast, yes? Breakfast
is most important meal of day.

69
00:09:52,169 --> 00:09:56,264
Here. Protein bar. Good for bones.

70
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:59,060
Deadpool may try to break yours.

71
00:10:26,523 --> 00:10:28,121
Hey!

72
00:10:38,706 --> 00:10:42,601
Wait! You may be wondering
why the red suit.

73
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,397
Well that's so bad guys
can't see me bleed.

74
00:10:45,497 --> 00:10:48,393
This guy's got the right idea.
He wore the brown pants.

75
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:54,185
Fine! I only have 12 bullets, so
you're gonna have to share!

76
00:10:54,385 --> 00:10:55,983
Let's count 'em down!

77
00:11:15,635 --> 00:11:20,939
Shit, motherfucker!

78
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:22,840
Ten! Shit.

79
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:27,645
Nine! Fuck.
Eight. Shit-fuck!

80
00:11:30,847 --> 00:11:32,649
Bad Deadpool.

81
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:36,051
Seven. Good Deadpool!

82
00:11:57,869 --> 00:11:59,872
Someone's not counting.

83
00:11:59,972 --> 00:12:01,073
Six!

84
00:12:27,093 --> 00:12:29,094
Four...

85
00:12:30,796 --> 00:12:32,097
Gotcha!

86
00:12:33,097 --> 00:12:35,600
Right up main street!

87
00:12:39,103 --> 00:12:42,806
Three, two! Stupid!
Worth it.

88
00:13:08,127 --> 00:13:11,129
I'm touching myself tonight.

89
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:14,132
Francis! Francis!

90
00:13:16,133 --> 00:13:20,737
What the shitbiscuit!
Where you at, Francis?

91
00:13:29,144 --> 00:13:31,146
You're not Francis!

92
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:41,155
Really? Rolling up the sleeves?

93
00:13:50,161 --> 00:13:58,867
You're probably thinking, "my boyfriend said this was a
superhero movie but that guy in the red suit just turned
that other guy into a fucking

94
00:13:58,968 --> 00:14:02,771
Well, I may be super. But I'm no hero.

95
00:14:03,171 --> 00:14:07,775
Anyhow, technically, this is a murder. But some
of the best love stories start with a murder.

96
00:14:07,975 --> 00:14:12,029
And that's exactly what this is:
a love story. And to tell it right,

97
00:14:12,129 --> 00:14:16,983
I gotta take you back to long before
I squeeze this ass into red spandex.

98
00:14:17,183 --> 00:14:22,788
Look, would it help if I slow it down
for you? I didn't order the pizza.

99
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:26,091
Is this 7348 Redledge Drive?

100
00:14:26,191 --> 00:14:30,994
- Are you Mr. Merchant?
- The Mr. Merchant who didn't order the fucking pie!

101
00:14:31,295 --> 00:14:33,797
- Who placed the call?
- I did!

102
00:14:35,197 --> 00:14:40,802
Pineapple and olive? Sweet and salty!

103
00:14:40,902 --> 00:14:43,805
The fuck are you? The fuck
are you doing in my crib?

104
00:14:44,005 --> 00:14:47,408
- Is that bread crust? Don't move!
- God, I hope not.

105
00:14:47,508 --> 00:14:51,211
Look, is this about that
poker game? I told Howie...

106
00:14:53,213 --> 00:14:56,215
- Just take whatever you want.
- Thanks!

107
00:14:56,616 --> 00:15:00,418
Sir, before you do anything to him,
do you mind if I get a big tip?

108
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,223
- Jeremy, is it? Wade Wilson.
- Yeah.

109
00:15:05,323 --> 00:15:08,926
That is a no go on the tip-aroo, Jer.

110
00:15:09,026 --> 00:15:12,229
I'm not here for him.
I'm here for you.

111
00:15:13,229 --> 00:15:18,033
- I dodged a big-time bullet on that one!
- Not, out of the woods yet.

112
00:15:18,233 --> 00:15:23,037
You need to seriously ease up on the
bedazzling. They're jeans, not a chandelier.

113
00:15:23,138 --> 00:15:25,239
P.S. I'm keeping your wallet.
You did kind of give it to me.

114
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,943
- Just look, man, can I have my---
- I will shoot your fucking cat.

115
00:15:30,243 --> 00:15:32,244
I don't really know what that
means, I don't have a cat.

116
00:15:32,545 --> 00:15:35,248
Then whose kitty litter did I just shit in?

117
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,551
Anywho...

118
00:15:39,852 --> 00:15:44,255
Tell me something. What situation
isn't improved by pizza?

119
00:15:44,555 --> 00:15:48,858
Do you happen to know a Megan
Orflosky? Get that right? Orflovsky?

120
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:53,962
'Cause she knows you. Jeremy...

121
00:15:54,262 --> 00:15:57,665
I belong to a group of guys who
take a dime to beat a fella down.

122
00:15:57,865 --> 00:16:02,469
And little Megan, she's not made of
money, but lucky for her, I got a soft spot.

123
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:05,271
- I'm.....
- A stalker.

124
00:16:05,371 --> 00:16:10,275
Threats hurt, Jer. Though not
nearly as badly as serrated steel.

125
00:16:10,376 --> 00:16:16,280
- So keep away from Megan. Cool?
- Yes, sir.

126
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:19,283
- And we're done.
- Wait, we are?

127
00:16:19,383 --> 00:16:23,086
Totally done. You should've seen your face!

128
00:16:23,286 --> 00:16:26,288
- I didn't know what to do, I was so scared...
- Soft spot, remember?

129
00:16:27,289 --> 00:16:33,294
Even look in her general direction again and you will learn
in the worst of ways that I have some hard spots, too.

130
00:16:34,295 --> 00:16:36,297
That came out wrong.

131
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:39,299
Or did it?

132
00:16:51,309 --> 00:16:53,311
Megan.

133
00:16:55,313 --> 00:16:58,515
You've heard the last
of Jeremy. He's sorry.

134
00:16:58,816 --> 00:17:01,317
No friggin' way.

135
00:17:05,321 --> 00:17:08,323
Should've brought my roller blades.
Show these kids how it's done.

136
00:17:08,524 --> 00:17:11,325
And that's why we do it.
But mostly the money.

137
00:17:11,526 --> 00:17:13,327
Hey. Think you can
fuck up my step dad?

138
00:17:13,527 --> 00:17:16,330
If I can give the guy a pavement
facial, it's 'cause he's earned it.

139
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,332
Hey, wait.

140
00:17:19,332 --> 00:17:23,335
- You're my hero.
- No, no, no, no, no. That, I ain't.

141
00:17:25,338 --> 00:17:30,141
Nope. Never will be.
- Fuck you, Wade.

142
00:17:30,241 --> 00:17:33,344
I'm just a bad guy who gets
paid to fuck up worse guys.

143
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:39,349
Welcome to Sister Margaret's.
It's like a job fair for mercenaries.

144
00:17:39,449 --> 00:17:44,052
Think of us as really fucked up tooth fairies
except we knock out the teeth and take the cash.

145
00:17:44,352 --> 00:17:49,356
You'd best hope we never
see your name on a gold card.
(Buck! Liefeld.)

146
00:17:49,556 --> 00:17:52,359
- Hey, Wade!
- Wade Wilson. Patron Saint of the Pitiful.

147
00:17:52,459 --> 00:17:55,361
- What can I do for you?
- I'd love a blowjob.

148
00:17:55,461 --> 00:17:59,664
- Oh, God, me too.
- The drink. With snuggle. But first...

149
00:18:00,366 --> 00:18:05,369
- Hey, I ain't taking any babysitting money,
make sure that gets back to Miss...
- Orlovsky?

150
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:08,371
- You sure?
- Hmm.

151
00:18:08,472 --> 00:18:12,175
For a merc, you're pretty warm-blooded.
Bet you let the kid off easy, too.

152
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:19,381
He's not a bad kid. Just a little light stalking. I was way
worse when I was his age, travelling to exotic places...

153
00:18:19,481 --> 00:18:23,385
Baghdad, Mogadishu, Jacksonville,
meeting new and exciting people. And then..

154
00:18:23,485 --> 00:18:28,689
Killing them. Yeah, I've seen your instagram.
So what were special forces doing in Jacksonville?

155
00:18:28,889 --> 00:18:32,392
That's classified. They
have wonderful TGIFridays!

156
00:18:32,491 --> 00:18:36,395
Alright, kahlua, baileys
and whipped cream.

157
00:18:36,495 --> 00:18:38,397
I give you, a blowjob. I'm---

158
00:18:38,497 --> 00:18:41,399
- Why do you make me make that?
-  Kelly, Kelly, Kelly, Kelly...

159
00:18:41,499 --> 00:18:45,702
Take that over there to Buck, please and
tell him it's from Booth. Little foreplay.

160
00:18:45,903 --> 00:18:50,406
- Remind me what good will come of this?
- I don't take the shits, I just disturb them.

161
00:18:51,407 --> 00:18:53,409
What you want?

162
00:18:55,411 --> 00:18:59,414
- Cheers. To your health.
- Fuck you.

163
00:19:00,415 --> 00:19:02,416
That's a new stool.

164
00:19:07,421 --> 00:19:09,422
Stay the fuck down.

165
00:19:13,425 --> 00:19:15,527
Alright, move, move, move, move.

166
00:19:15,627 --> 00:19:16,628
Buck, go rest.

167
00:19:23,434 --> 00:19:25,435
He's still breathing.

168
00:19:27,437 --> 00:19:31,441
Nobody wins today. Nice try, Wade.

169
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:34,442
You got me. I picked Booth in
the dead pool. Who did you pick?

170
00:19:35,443 --> 00:19:40,447
- You know, Wade, about that....
- No. You did not bet on me to die.

171
00:19:42,449 --> 00:19:47,252
You bet on me to die. Wow. Motherfucker,
you're the world's worst friend.

172
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:52,457
Well, joke's on you. I'm living to 102.
And then die. At the city of Detroit.

173
00:19:52,557 --> 00:19:56,260
Sorry. I wanted to win money.
I never win anything.

174
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,463
- Whatever. Soldiers of fortune, drink's on me!
- Yeah!

175
00:20:01,464 --> 00:20:03,466
Domestic! Nothing imported.

176
00:20:05,468 --> 00:20:07,870
Woah, woah, woah. Baby...

177
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,471
Are you sure you wanna
shoot your whole wad?

178
00:20:13,475 --> 00:20:15,476
Tight.

179
00:20:15,976 --> 00:20:17,977
- Vanessa.
- Wade.

180
00:20:18,478 --> 00:20:21,481
What's a nice place like
you doing in a girl like this?

181
00:20:21,581 --> 00:20:23,482
I'd hit that.

182
00:20:24,484 --> 00:20:28,487
Buck, you'd best apologize
before--- yeah. That.

183
00:20:28,587 --> 00:20:31,489
- Say the magic words, fat Gandalf.
- I'm sorry.

184
00:20:31,589 --> 00:20:35,493
- Breathe through the nose.
- I don't have a filter between my brain and my...

185
00:20:35,592 --> 00:20:39,496
Okay, hey. Hakuna
his tatas, he's sorry!

186
00:20:39,596 --> 00:20:44,500
- Get outta here. Go cast a spell.
- Hey, hands off the merchandise.

187
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,504
Merchandise, huh. So you...

188
00:20:49,604 --> 00:20:52,506
- Fun fuzzies for money?
- Yup.

189
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:56,310
- Rough childhood?
- Rougher than yours. Daddy left before I was born.

190
00:20:56,509 --> 00:20:59,513
Daddy left before I was conceived.

191
00:20:59,613 --> 00:21:02,515
- Ever had a cigarette put out on your skin?
- Where else do you put one out?

192
00:21:02,615 --> 00:21:05,317
- I was molested.
- Me, too. Uncle.

193
00:21:05,517 --> 00:21:11,522
- Uncles. They took turns.
- I watched my own birthday party through the keyhole
of a locked closet which also happens to be my...

194
00:21:11,623 --> 00:21:15,525
Your bedroom. Lucky. I
slept in a dishwasher box.

195
00:21:15,626 --> 00:21:22,831
You had a dishwasher. I didn't even know sleep. It was
pretty much 24/7 ball kegs, brownie mix and clown porn.

196
00:21:25,533 --> 00:21:27,534
Who would do such a thing?

197
00:21:28,535 --> 00:21:32,539
Hopefully, you. Later tonight?

198
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:42,546
What can I get for 275 dollars
and a yogurt rewards card?

199
00:21:42,646 --> 00:21:45,550
Baby, about 48 minutes of
whatever the fuck you want.

200
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:49,552
And a low-fat dessert.

201
00:21:55,558 --> 00:21:58,560
Did she just put a gift
card in your mouth?

202
00:21:59,561 --> 00:22:02,563
It's time to put
balls in holes.

203
00:22:02,663 --> 00:22:05,566
- You said whatever I want.
- I get it.

204
00:22:06,567 --> 00:22:11,571
- You love ski ball. Apparently more than you love vagina.
- That's a tough call.

205
00:22:11,871 --> 00:22:18,577
I just wanna get to know the real you. Not the short-
shorted 2-dimensional sex object peddled by Hollywood.

206
00:22:19,578 --> 00:22:21,579
Balls in holes.

207
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,582
- Prepare to lose tragically.
- Bring it, big man.

208
00:22:32,588 --> 00:22:37,592
A limited edition Voltron: Defender
of the Universe ring, por favor.

209
00:22:37,592 --> 00:22:39,594
Okay. Here you go.
A limited edition Voltron: Defender
of the Universe ring, por favor.

210
00:22:40,595 --> 00:22:42,597
I had this sucker for a while.

211
00:22:42,697 --> 00:22:45,099
- And I will take the pencil eraser.
- Okay.

212
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:52,605
You are now the proud protector of the planet Arus.
And you, can erase stuff. Written in pencil.

213
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:57,609
- Milady.
- I hate to break it to you,
but your 48 minutes are up.

214
00:22:58,109 --> 00:23:00,611
How many more minutes
could I get for this?

215
00:23:00,711 --> 00:23:05,616
FYI, 5 mini lion bots come
together to form 1 superbot.

216
00:23:05,716 --> 00:23:12,921
- 5 mini lion bots? 3 minutes.
- Deal. What do we do with the remaining 2:37?

217
00:23:13,122 --> 00:23:14,122
Cuddle?

218
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:22,628
- How long can we keep this up?
- All year?

219
00:23:31,636 --> 00:23:34,639
Happy Valentines' Day.

220
00:23:40,643 --> 00:23:44,646
- Happy Chinese New Year.
- Year of the Dog.

221
00:23:49,651 --> 00:23:54,655
Relax... and happy
International Women's Day.

222
00:24:03,662 --> 00:24:05,664
Happy Lenten.

223
00:24:09,668 --> 00:24:14,671
- Wade!
- Sorry. Happy Halloween!

224
00:24:22,678 --> 00:24:25,680
Happy Thanksgiving.

225
00:24:26,681 --> 00:24:28,683
I love you.

226
00:24:31,686 --> 00:24:35,689
If your left leg is Thanksgiving,
and your right leg is Christmas...

227
00:24:36,289 --> 00:24:39,692
Can I visit you
between the holidays?

228
00:24:39,792 --> 00:24:42,695
That sweater is terrible!

229
00:24:43,696 --> 00:24:45,697
But red looks good on you.

230
00:24:45,797 --> 00:24:48,699
Red's your color. Mine's like
the bloodshot in your eyes.

231
00:24:49,662 --> 00:24:51,554
- Listen. I've been thinking.
- Really?

232
00:24:53,247 --> 00:24:56,234
- 'Bout why we're so good together.
- Why is that?

233
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:01,212
Your crazy matches
my crazy. Bigtime.

234
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:06,191
And we're like 2 jigsaw
pieces. Weird curvy edges?

235
00:25:06,289 --> 00:25:10,172
- You put them together and you
can see the picture on top.
- Right.

236
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:15,151
Wade... There's something I've
been meaning to ask you.

237
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:18,138
But only because you haven't
gotten around to asking me.

238
00:25:19,134 --> 00:25:21,124
Will you...

239
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:25,107
- Stick it up my---
- ...Marry me?

240
00:25:26,103 --> 00:25:28,094
Uh... Jinx?

241
00:25:30,086 --> 00:25:32,076
- Where were you hiding that?
- Nowhere.

242
00:25:32,176 --> 00:25:35,461
- They said 1-month salary, so ...
- You mean...

243
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,051
- I do.
- That's my line.

244
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:44,721
- I love you, Wade Wilson.
- You're supposed to... So that's a...

245
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,012
- Yes!
- Woo! Yes!

246
00:25:49,998 --> 00:25:51,990
I feel just like a little girl!

247
00:25:56,968 --> 00:26:02,942
- What if I just held on and never let go?
- Just ride the bitch's back like Yoda on Luke.

248
00:26:03,041 --> 00:26:06,924
- Star Wars jokes!
- Empire!

249
00:26:07,921 --> 00:26:10,907
Jesus Christ, it's like I
made you in a computer!

250
00:26:16,881 --> 00:26:18,872
Perfect.

251
00:26:22,855 --> 00:26:25,842
Pee break. Shake it, yeah.

252
00:26:30,821 --> 00:26:32,812
Here's the thing:

253
00:26:32,911 --> 00:26:37,790
Life is an endless series of train wrecks with
only brief commercial-like breaks of happiness.

254
00:26:38,786 --> 00:26:42,769
This had been the
ultimate commercial break.

255
00:26:43,763 --> 00:26:47,746
Which meant it was time to return,
to our regularly scheduled programme.

256
00:26:48,046 --> 00:26:50,733
- What the fu.....
- Oh my God, Wade!

257
00:26:56,707 --> 00:27:01,686
You're clowning. You're
not clowning. I sense clowns.

258
00:27:02,182 --> 00:27:05,667
People react to news of late-
stage cancer differently.

259
00:27:05,768 --> 00:27:10,646
There are certainly options we can look into.
New drugs are being developed every day.

260
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:18,611
So what do we do? Surely,
there is something we can do.

261
00:27:18,711 --> 00:27:24,884
My Uncle Ivan was diagnosed with Thyroid cancer and
there were all these experimental drugs from Germany...

262
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:28,567
Vanessa's already working on plan
A, B, all the way through Z.

263
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:35,819
Me? I'm memorizing the details of her
face. Like it's the first time I'm seeing it.

264
00:27:36,219 --> 00:27:38,614
- Or the last...
- Mr. Wilson, Mr. Wilson?

265
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:46,600
Take your time to process this. It's
important not to do anything rash.

266
00:27:57,579 --> 00:28:02,571
Now, if I were a 200 pound sack of assholes
named Francis, where would I hide?

267
00:28:28,523 --> 00:28:36,509
"A hush falls over the crowd as rookie sensation Wade W.
Wilson out of Regina, Saskatchewan, lines up the shot."

268
00:28:37,506 --> 00:28:39,503
"His form looks good."

269
00:28:41,499 --> 00:28:45,991
"And that's why Regina
rhymes with fun."

270
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:50,781
"Ladies and gentlemen, what you're
witnessing is sweet, dick-kicking revenge!"

271
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,473
"Giving him the business! Incoming!"

272
00:28:55,573 --> 00:28:59,466
"This is taking unsportsman-like
conduct to a whole new level!"

273
00:29:04,456 --> 00:29:08,249
Looking good, Francis. Well-rested.
Like you've been pitching, not catching.

274
00:29:08,449 --> 00:29:11,443
Ringing any bells? No?

275
00:29:15,436 --> 00:29:17,433
How 'bout now?

276
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:23,421
Wade fucking Wilson.

277
00:29:25,418 --> 00:29:30,408
- Well, hello, gorgeous.
- Yeah, like I got bit by a radioactive Shar Pei.

278
00:29:30,509 --> 00:29:35,400
And whose fault is that, huh, Francis? Time
to undo what you did to this butter face.

279
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:40,391
You should thank me. Apparently, I've made
you immortal. I'm actually quite jealous.

280
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:43,884
Yeah, but this ain't a
life worth living, is it? Now...

281
00:29:45,237 --> 00:29:50,241
I'm about to do to you what Limp
Bizkit did to music in the late 90's.

282
00:29:51,242 --> 00:29:53,244
Dad?

283
00:29:56,247 --> 00:30:00,251
I think we can all agree that shit just went
sideways in the most colossal way.

284
00:30:01,252 --> 00:30:03,854
Well, maybe not the most.

285
00:30:04,855 --> 00:30:07,758
Now this, is my most prized possession.

286
00:30:08,258 --> 00:30:11,762
- Wham?
- No, no, no, no. WHAM!

287
00:30:12,021 --> 00:30:15,265
Make It Big is the album that George and
Andy earned the exclamation point.

288
00:30:15,365 --> 00:30:19,269
So, am I supposed to just
smile and wave you out the door?

289
00:30:19,369 --> 00:30:22,271
Think of it like spring cleaning.
Only if spring was death.

290
00:30:22,371 --> 00:30:26,275
God, if I had a nickel for everytime I
spanked at the Bernadette Peters.

291
00:30:27,276 --> 00:30:30,312
Sounds like you have.
Bernadette is not going...

292
00:30:30,337 --> 00:30:33,305
...anywhere, because you're
not going anywhere.

293
00:30:33,949 --> 00:30:35,250
- Drink.
- You're right.

294
00:30:35,451 --> 00:30:38,954
Cancer's only in my liver, lungs, prostate
and brain. All things I can live without.

295
00:30:40,955 --> 00:30:46,860
You belong here at home. Surrounded by your
Voltron, and your Bernadette and your me.

296
00:30:46,961 --> 00:30:51,965
Listen, we both know
that cancer is a shit show.

297
00:34:06,661 --> 00:34:09,763
Not a good one, like Slapchop,
more Shakeweighty.

298
00:34:09,962 --> 00:34:14,966
The world needs extraordinary soldiers.
We won't just make you better.

299
00:34:15,366 --> 00:34:18,168
We will make you better than better.

300
00:34:19,668 --> 00:34:21,245
A superhero.

301
00:34:21,269 --> 00:34:25,996
Look, Agent Smith, I tried the
hero business and it left a mark.

302
00:34:26,072 --> 00:34:28,974
But if I ever hit fuck
-it, I'll look you up.

303
00:34:29,975 --> 00:34:31,776
Oh. Shit.

304
00:34:31,976 --> 00:34:35,978
We're within 500 yards of the school.
So you may wanna, you know...

305
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,981
His drink's on him.

306
00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:47,985
What'd he say?

307
00:35:09,318 --> 00:35:10,736
Hey, what's going on?

308
00:35:11,832 --> 00:35:16,435
Hey, sorry. I had a
Liam Neeson nightmare.

309
00:35:17,435 --> 00:35:20,737
I dreamt I kidnapped his daughter
and he just wasn't having it.

310
00:35:30,743 --> 00:35:32,744
They made 3 of those movies.

311
00:35:33,745 --> 00:35:36,746
At some point, you'd have to
wonder if he's just a bad parent.

312
00:35:50,756 --> 00:35:54,057
The worst part about cancer
isn't what it does to you.

313
00:35:54,758 --> 00:35:56,759
But what it does to
the people you love.

314
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:04,764
Who knew if this guy could save my life? But I
knew there's only one way that I could save hers.

315
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:10,357
Isn't that what superheroes do?

316
00:36:24,069 --> 00:36:28,071
Okay. Let's pro/con
this superhero thing.

317
00:36:29,072 --> 00:36:34,875
Pro: they pull down a gaggle of ass, local dry
cleaning discounts, lucrative film deals,

318
00:36:35,076 --> 00:36:38,078
both origin stories and larger,
ensemble team movies.

319
00:36:38,578 --> 00:36:41,679
Con: they're all lame-ass teacher's pets!

320
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,982
- You know I can hear you.
- Wasn't talking to you. I was talking to them.

321
00:36:46,082 --> 00:36:51,084
Stay right here. You've been
warned before, Deadpool.

322
00:36:51,184 --> 00:36:56,588
This is a shameful and reckless use of your
powers. You will both be coming with us.

323
00:36:56,688 --> 00:37:03,091
Look Colossus, I don't have time for the goody
two-shoes bullshit right now. And you are?

324
00:37:04,092 --> 00:37:06,093
Negasonic Teenage Warhead.

325
00:37:06,194 --> 00:37:09,696
Negasonic Teenage---
What the shit?!

326
00:37:09,897 --> 00:37:12,098
That's the coolest name ever!

327
00:37:13,098 --> 00:37:17,100
- So what, you're like his sidekick?
- No. Trainee.

328
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:22,603
- Let me guess, X-Men left you behind
on what, shit detail?
- What does that make you?

329
00:37:22,904 --> 00:37:26,105
Pretending you're not here, Negasonic
Teenage Warhead. Can we trade names?

330
00:37:27,106 --> 00:37:30,908
- Can we go?
- "Look! I'm a teenage girl!"

331
00:37:31,109 --> 00:37:38,113
"I'd rather be anywhere than here. I'm all about long, sullen
silences, followed by mean comments, followed by more silences."

332
00:37:39,114 --> 00:37:44,116
So what's it gonna be? Long, sullen
silence? Or mean comment? Go on.

333
00:37:46,118 --> 00:37:52,121
- You got me in a box here.
- We can't allow this, Deadpool. Please, come quietly.

334
00:37:52,221 --> 00:37:55,123
- You big, chrome cockgobbler!
- That's not nice.

335
00:37:55,223 --> 00:37:58,125
You really got to fuck
this up for me? Trust me...

336
00:37:58,225 --> 00:38:04,128
That wheezing bag of dick-tits
has it coming! He's pure evil!

337
00:38:04,228 --> 00:38:08,131
Besides, nobody's getting hurt.

338
00:38:13,134 --> 00:38:16,135
That guy was already
up there when I got here.

339
00:38:16,235 --> 00:38:20,663
Wade, you are better than this.
Join us, use your powers for good.

340
00:38:20,688 --> 00:38:22,163
Heads up!

341
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,942
- Be a superhero.
- Listen! The day I decide to be a crime-fighting shit-swizzler,

342
00:38:27,142 --> 00:38:35,746
who rooms with a bunch of other little whiners, at the Neverland
Mansion of some creepy, old, bald, heaven's gate looking motherfucker,

343
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:42,150
on that day, I'll send your shiny, happy ass a friend
request. But until then, I'mma do what I came here to do.

344
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:44,152
- Either that, or slap the bitch out of you!
- Wade...

345
00:38:45,152 --> 00:38:48,754
- Hey. Hey, Douchepool!
- Zip it, Sinead!

346
00:38:48,954 --> 00:38:51,156
And I hope you're watching...

347
00:38:54,157 --> 00:38:56,158
Quite unfortunate.

348
00:38:59,161 --> 00:39:02,162
That does it!

349
00:39:05,164 --> 00:39:07,166
Canada!

350
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:12,168
- That's not good. Cock shot!
- Wade, please.

351
00:39:13,169 --> 00:39:16,170
Oh, your poor wife!

352
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,172
You really should stop.

353
00:39:20,473 --> 00:39:23,575
All the dinosaurs fear the T-Rex.

354
00:39:27,177 --> 00:39:31,179
- I promise this gets worse for you, big boy!
- This is embarassing.

355
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:34,182
Please. Stay down.

356
00:39:35,182 --> 00:39:37,884
Did you ever hear of the one-legged
man in the ass-kicking contest?

357
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:41,886
- Do you have 'off' switch?
- Yeah, it's right next to the prostate. Or is that the 'on' switch?

358
00:39:42,186 --> 00:39:43,487
Enough!

359
00:39:52,192 --> 00:39:54,193
Let us go talk to the Professor.

360
00:39:55,194 --> 00:39:59,797
McAvoy or Stewart? These
timelines are so confusing...

361
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:05,600
- Dead or alive, you're coming with me!
- You will recover, Wade. You always do.

362
00:40:11,038 --> 00:40:14,049
Did you ever see "127 Hours"?
Spoiler alert!

363
00:40:18,064 --> 00:40:21,075
Oh my God. Nasty.

364
00:40:23,082 --> 00:40:29,105
Oh, there's the money shot, baby. Are
you there, God? It's me, Margaret.

365
00:40:39,142 --> 00:40:41,150
Rock, meet bottom.

366
00:40:42,154 --> 00:40:49,180
When life ends up breathtakingly fucked, you can
generally trace it back to one big, bad decision.

367
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,191
The one that sent you
down the road to Shitsburg.

368
00:40:52,291 --> 00:40:55,202
This, well, this was mine.

369
00:40:56,206 --> 00:41:02,229
Mr. Wilson. Nothing warms my heart
more than a change of someone else's.

370
00:41:03,233 --> 00:41:06,244
You've finally hit fuck-it.

371
00:41:06,345 --> 00:41:12,267
- Just promise you'll do right by me.
So I can do right by someone else.
- Of course.

372
00:41:13,271 --> 00:41:18,289
And please don't make the
super-suit green. Or animated!

373
00:41:38,365 --> 00:41:43,384
This place seems sanitary.
My first request is warmer hands.

374
00:41:43,484 --> 00:41:47,399
And Jesus! A warmer table.

375
00:41:48,402 --> 00:41:53,421
You should really come up with a safe
word, fellas. I'm thinking 'pork and beans'.

376
00:41:55,905 --> 00:41:57,913
Easy!

377
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:00,765
Aren't you a little strong for a lady?

378
00:42:01,746 --> 00:42:04,758
I'm calling Wang.

379
00:42:06,765 --> 00:42:11,784
What's up with the matches?
Oral fixation? Or just a big Stallone fan?

380
00:42:12,787 --> 00:42:18,807
- Patience, Angel. All in good time.
- Are you here for the turn down service or what?

381
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,572
- We have another talker.
- I'm just excited about my first day at superhero camp.

382
00:42:23,773 --> 00:42:25,795
Shut the fuck up.

383
00:42:28,847 --> 00:42:33,866
Mr. Wilson, my name's
Ajax. I manage this workshop.

384
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:37,881
All of my welcome speeches used
to be filled with euphemisms like,

385
00:42:37,881 --> 00:42:41,896
"this may hurt a little," or
"this might cause you some discomfort."

386
00:42:41,996 --> 00:42:46,313
But I'm going blunt. This workshop
is not a government-led program.

387
00:42:46,915 --> 00:42:51,231
It's a private institution that turns reclamation
projects like yourself into men of....

388
00:42:51,933 --> 00:42:54,944
Extraordinary abilities.

389
00:42:55,948 --> 00:43:00,967
But if you think superhuman powers
are acquired painlessly... Wrong.

390
00:43:01,469 --> 00:43:05,685
I'm injecting you with a serum that activates
any mutant genes lurking in your DNA.

391
00:43:05,885 --> 00:43:11,005
For it to work, we need to
subject you to extreme stress.

392
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:19,035
You've heard the whole, "make an
omelet, break some eggs" bit, I hope.

393
00:43:19,437 --> 00:43:24,054
I'm about to hurt you, Wade. I was
a patient here once myself, you know.

394
00:43:25,058 --> 00:43:30,076
The treatment affects everyone differently.
It made Angel inhumanly strong.

395
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:38,408
In my case, it enhanced my reflexes, also scorched
my nerve endings so I no longer feel pain.

396
00:43:40,115 --> 00:43:43,728
And in fact, I no
longer feel anything.

397
00:43:53,163 --> 00:43:57,178
Thank-- thank you! You
have something in your teeth.

398
00:43:58,182 --> 00:44:03,201
Right in the middle there, just...
Nugget of romaine lettuce or something.

399
00:44:05,208 --> 00:44:07,215
It's been bothering
me for a long time.

400
00:44:09,222 --> 00:44:14,744
Made you look. Hey, is Ajax your actual name,
because it sounds suspiciously made up.

401
00:44:14,844 --> 00:44:22,472
What is it really? Kevin? Bruce? Scott?
Mitch? Rickster? Is it Basil Faulty?

402
00:44:22,581 --> 00:44:27,190
Joke away. One thing that never survives
this place is your sense of humor.

403
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:30,302
- We'll see about that.
- I suppose we will.

404
00:44:31,305 --> 00:44:38,331
- He's all yours.
- C'mon. You're gonna leave me all alone
here with less angry Rosie O'Donnell?

405
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:50,376
This is how it's going to work. Adrenaline acts as a catalyst
for the serum, so we're gonna have to make you suffer.

406
00:44:51,381 --> 00:44:56,400
If you're lucky, your mutant genes will
activate and manifest in a spectacular fashion.

407
00:45:01,418 --> 00:45:04,430
If not, well, we'll have
to keep on hurting you.

408
00:45:05,433 --> 00:45:09,448
In new and different ways,
each more painful than the last.

409
00:45:11,456 --> 00:45:14,467
Until you finally mutate...

410
00:45:15,471 --> 00:45:17,429
... or die.

411
00:45:23,501 --> 00:45:30,528
- You mean like a bucket list?
- Like a fuck it list, I'd like to light a
spiff off the Olympic torch.

412
00:45:30,628 --> 00:45:33,137
Acid to me, right after.

413
00:45:33,237 --> 00:45:39,561
Let's not forget: naked tandem base-jumping
with the WNBA's Sacramento Monarchs.

414
00:45:39,662 --> 00:45:42,573
Anything on my bucket list
would involve public nudity.

415
00:45:43,576 --> 00:45:46,588
Finally, giving Meredith
Baxter Birney a dutch oven.

416
00:45:46,688 --> 00:45:50,201
No, receiving a dutch oven
from Meredith Baxter Birney.

417
00:45:53,614 --> 00:45:57,629
Making banana
pancakes... For my kids...

418
00:46:01,041 --> 00:46:03,651
Vanessa...

419
00:46:06,662 --> 00:46:09,674
I wanna see Vanessa.

420
00:46:09,774 --> 00:46:13,688
Oh, lovely. I don't know about
anyone else but, I'm touched.

421
00:46:13,789 --> 00:46:20,715
- We're just joking.
- No, no. It's okay. I encourage distractions.

422
00:46:20,815 --> 00:46:23,726
Wouldn't want you giving
up on us now, would we?

423
00:46:23,726 --> 00:46:27,741
Hey, don't take any shit from him,
Cunningham. How tough can he be...

424
00:46:28,745 --> 00:46:32,759
- ... with a name like Francis?
- Francis?

425
00:46:33,763 --> 00:46:38,782
It's his legal name. He
got Ajax from a dish soap.

426
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:45,809
F-R-A-N-C-I--- oops!

427
00:46:48,519 --> 00:46:51,831
Snagged the dry cleaning
tag off your lab coat.

428
00:46:51,932 --> 00:46:55,846
FYI, I can probably get
you a superhero discount.

429
00:46:55,947 --> 00:46:59,861
- You are so relentlessly annoying.
- Thanks. Never heard that before.

430
00:46:59,962 --> 00:47:04,880
Why don't you do us all a favor and shut
the fuck up? Or I'll sew your pretty mouth shut.

431
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:09,573
Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you.

432
00:47:09,672 --> 00:47:15,659
See, here's the problem with round-the-clock
torture, it's that you can't really step it up from there.

433
00:47:17,656 --> 00:47:20,649
Is that what you think?

434
00:47:25,639 --> 00:47:30,329
If this doesn't unlock your
mutation, then, well, nothing will.

435
00:47:30,629 --> 00:47:36,615
What we're gonna do is lower the oxygen concentration in
the air to the exact point you feel like you're suffocating.

436
00:47:36,715 --> 00:47:42,602
If your brain wave's slowing and you're about
to pass out, then we'll turn up the O2.

437
00:47:42,703 --> 00:47:47,592
If your heart rate slows meaning you're able
to catch your breath, we'll turn it back down.

438
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:52,581
And that's where we'll
leave you. Right there.

439
00:47:53,578 --> 00:47:57,570
- I thought you guys were dicks before...
- You know the funniest part of this?

440
00:47:58,568 --> 00:48:01,561
You still think we're
making you a superhero.

441
00:48:01,662 --> 00:48:08,347
You? A dishonorable discharge?
Hip deep in hookers?

442
00:48:08,547 --> 00:48:13,536
You're nothing. A little secret, Wade...

443
00:48:13,636 --> 00:48:17,528
This workshop doesn't make
superheroes, we make superslaves.

444
00:48:18,526 --> 00:48:23,515
We're gonna fit you with a control collar
and auction you off to the highest bidder.

445
00:48:23,615 --> 00:48:28,504
And that's what they'll have you doing. Terrorizing
citizens, putting down freedom fighters.

446
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:33,494
Maybe just mow
the occasional lawn.

447
00:48:34,492 --> 00:48:36,487
What the fuck is wrong with you?

448
00:48:41,477 --> 00:48:47,165
You're never going home after
this. Now there's a brave face.

449
00:48:47,464 --> 00:48:50,458
Wait, wait, wait...

450
00:48:51,456 --> 00:48:56,445
Seriously, you actually have
something in your teeth now.

451
00:48:57,443 --> 00:49:03,430
- Enjoy your weekend.
- Weekend? Back up, weekend?

452
00:49:44,342 --> 00:49:49,332
Did I say this was a love
story? No. It's a horror movie.

453
00:50:05,299 --> 00:50:10,288
Fucking hell! Looks like someone
lost a shot at homecoming king.

454
00:50:10,388 --> 00:50:16,275
- What have you done to me?
- I've mainly raised your stress levels
high enough to trigger a mutation.

455
00:50:16,375 --> 00:50:21,265
- You sadistic fuck!
- I've cured you, Wade.

456
00:50:21,364 --> 00:50:27,252
Now your mutated cells can heal anything.
Striking your cancer as fast as it can form.

457
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:33,239
Yeah, I've seen some other side
effects before... I could cure them.

458
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:38,228
But where's the fun in that?

459
00:50:40,225 --> 00:50:43,218
Now I'm gonna shut
you in again, Wade.

460
00:50:44,705 --> 00:50:48,208
Not because I need to.

461
00:50:51,201 --> 00:50:53,197
Because I want to.

462
00:51:07,168 --> 00:51:10,161
Farewell. Go ahead.

463
00:51:12,156 --> 00:51:15,150
You already smell like shit.

464
00:51:18,144 --> 00:51:22,136
- Motherfucker...
- That's alright, it's alright...

465
00:51:22,236 --> 00:51:29,121
I think we have earned that one.
You take off. Go on, off you go.

466
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:42,092
Quick question:

467
00:51:44,088 --> 00:51:46,083
What's my name?

468
00:51:51,073 --> 00:51:54,067
Didn't think so.

469
00:51:55,065 --> 00:51:58,058
Sorry, Francis. My lips are sealed.

470
00:53:54,025 --> 00:53:58,638
You don't wanna kill me. I'm the
only one who can fix your ugly mug!

471
00:54:54,529 --> 00:54:56,524
What's my name?

472
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:04,504
Wade...

473
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:18,320
I didn't just get the cure to el cancer...
I got the cure to el everything.

474
00:56:21,312 --> 00:56:26,300
But there was only one
thing that really mattered.

475
00:57:47,098 --> 00:57:50,789
No way. I'm not making
her life as ugly as mine.

476
00:57:50,988 --> 00:57:56,076
- Come on, Wade, it can't be that bad.
- Bullshit! I'm a monster inside now.

477
00:57:56,175 --> 00:57:59,767
- I belong in a fucking circus.
- Wade, Vanessa loves you.

478
00:57:59,966 --> 00:58:03,058
- She doesn't care what you--- Oh!
- Do you like what you see?

479
00:58:03,158 --> 00:58:09,841
No. You look like an avocado had sex
with an older, more disgusting avocado.

480
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:18,021
Not gently. He was hate-fucking. There was something wrong with the relationship and that was their only catharsis without violence.

481
00:58:18,121 --> 00:58:25,603
And the only guy who can fix this fugly mug is the British
shitstick who ran the mutant factory. And he's gone--- Poof!

482
00:58:25,802 --> 00:58:29,492
You gotta do something to remedy this. 'Cause
as of now, you only have one course of action:

483
00:58:29,991 --> 00:58:33,582
- Damn straight. Find Francis.
- Star in horror fims.

484
00:58:33,782 --> 00:58:36,774
- What?
- Star in your own horror films.

485
00:58:36,874 --> 00:58:40,465
'Cause you look like Freddy Krueger face-
fucked a topographical map of Utah.

486
00:58:41,363 --> 00:58:42,759
Here's what I'm actually gonna do:

487
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:49,942
I'm gonna work thru his crew until somebody gives up Francis,
force him to fix this, put a bullet in his skull, and fuck the brainhole.

488
00:58:50,041 --> 00:58:52,934
I don't wanna see that,
or think of it again. But,

489
00:58:53,034 --> 00:58:55,926
- the douchebag does think you're dead, right?
- Yeah.

490
00:58:56,027 --> 00:58:59,916
- That's good. You should keep it that way.
- What, like, wear a mask?

491
00:59:00,016 --> 00:59:06,899
Yes, a very thick mask. All the
time. I'm sorry, you're haunting.

492
00:59:06,999 --> 00:59:10,589
- Your face is the stuff of nightmares.
- Like a testicle with teeth.

493
00:59:10,689 --> 00:59:16,874
You will die alone. I mean if you
could die. Ideally. For others' sake.

494
00:59:16,973 --> 00:59:21,862
- That'll do.
- What you need now is a suit and a
nickname, like Wade the Wisecracker...

495
00:59:21,961 --> 00:59:28,844
- ... or Scaredevil, Mr. Neverdie. Oh, shit.
- What?

496
00:59:29,841 --> 00:59:34,829
- I put all my money on you, and now I
just realized I'm never gonna win the....
- Deadpool...

497
00:59:37,821 --> 00:59:40,815
Captain Deadpool.

498
00:59:41,811 --> 00:59:44,805
No. Just-just Deadpool. Yeah.

499
00:59:44,904 --> 00:59:50,789
To you, Mr. Pool. Deadpool. That
sounds like a fuckin' franchise.

500
01:00:04,754 --> 01:00:06,750
This shit's gonna
have nuts in it!

501
01:00:23,217 --> 01:00:25,289
Where's Francis?

502
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:40,623
Seltzer water and lemon for
blood. Or wear red. Dumbass!

503
01:00:59,787 --> 01:01:01,918
Don't make me ask twice.

504
01:01:28,294 --> 01:01:31,805
You're about to be
killed by a Zamboni!

505
01:01:33,717 --> 01:01:38,889
- No, please...
- Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

506
01:01:39,925 --> 01:01:43,031
Little spider-monkey!

507
01:01:50,276 --> 01:01:57,521
This is confusing! Is it sexist to hit you, is it
more sexist to not hit you, the line gets real blurry!

508
01:01:57,624 --> 01:01:59,590
Donde esta Francesca?

509
01:02:00,626 --> 01:02:06,837
Tell me where your fucking boss is!
Or you're gonna die! In 5 minutes!

510
01:02:33,695 --> 01:02:40,671
Nice to see you, Jared. I'll
take a foot long. Fully loaded.

511
01:02:55,620 --> 01:03:02,098
- 41 confirmed kills. Now it's 89, about to be 90.
- Mr. Wilson?

512
01:03:03,593 --> 01:03:08,575
- You're looking very alive.
- Hah! Only on the outside.

513
01:03:08,675 --> 01:03:11,565
- This is not going to end---
- This is not gonna end well for you, no.

514
01:03:11,665 --> 01:03:14,555
- Where's your boss?
- I can tell you exactly where---

515
01:03:15,551 --> 01:03:22,528
You'll tell me. But first, you might wanna look
away for this. Now this little piggy went to...

516
01:03:23,645 --> 01:03:25,693
Thank you, Agent Smith.

517
01:03:29,789 --> 01:03:31,930
Taxi!

518
01:03:31,930 --> 01:03:32,129
Hop in! Great day for a ride.
Taxi!

519
01:03:32,129 --> 01:03:35,462
Hop in! Great day for a ride.

520
01:03:36,639 --> 01:03:38,993
And we all know
how this turned out.

521
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:43,106
Whoops! You weren't
meant to see that.

522
01:03:51,413 --> 01:03:54,973
There. All caught up.

523
01:04:03,492 --> 01:04:08,319
Sorry! About bleeding
at all your garbage.

524
01:04:14,353 --> 01:04:16,426
Seltzer water and
lemon for blood.

525
01:04:16,426 --> 01:04:17,976
Some kinds of anger
can't be managed.
Seltzer water and
lemon for blood.

526
01:04:17,976 --> 01:04:19,633
Some kinds of anger
can't be managed.

527
01:04:19,756 --> 01:04:26,292
Like the kind where your year-long plan
ends with the wrong guy getting dismembered!

528
01:04:26,415 --> 01:04:32,458
That said, when it comes time to licking
wounds, there's no place like home.

529
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:11,598
Morning, sleepyhead.

530
01:05:12,577 --> 01:05:17,179
- It smells like old lady pants in here.
- Yes I'm old, I wear pants.

531
01:05:17,276 --> 01:05:20,407
But you're no lady.
Oh, so comfy.

532
01:05:22,366 --> 01:05:26,967
- Upside of being blind, I've never seen you in crocs.
- You mean my big, rubber, masturbating shoes?

533
01:05:27,066 --> 01:05:33,134
Yes I know. Downside of being blind,
I hear everything in this duplex.

534
01:05:34,995 --> 01:05:38,031
- Sit on a stick.
- Bactine?

535
01:05:39,009 --> 01:05:40,967
Bactine should do it.

536
01:05:41,945 --> 01:05:46,840
How's that () coming along? Ikea
doesn't assemble itself, you know.

537
01:05:46,938 --> 01:05:51,735
You're telling me. I don't mind the ().
It's an improvement on the ().

538
01:05:51,735 --> 01:05:54,280
Anything's an improvement over the ().

539
01:05:54,672 --> 01:05:57,609
I'd taken an () or a () over the ().

540
01:05:59,568 --> 01:06:01,329
No, I didn't get
excited 'till I saw ().

541
01:06:01,525 --> 01:06:05,245
- Screw, please.
- Here? Now? Just kidding. I know it's been decades.

542
01:06:05,344 --> 01:06:08,378
- You'd be surprised.
- Pretty grossed out.

543
01:06:09,357 --> 01:06:12,293
Ta------da...

544
01:06:17,952 --> 01:06:21,105
I wish I never heard, of Craigslist.

545
01:06:21,203 --> 01:06:27,664
And I quote, "Looking for roommate, blind, and likes imperfections. Must be good with hands." Or would you rather I build the Ikea and you pay rent?

546
01:06:27,761 --> 01:06:30,894
- Why such a douche this morning?
- Let's recap:

547
01:06:30,993 --> 01:06:35,790
The cock-fizzle that turned me into this
freak slipped through my arms today.

548
01:06:36,768 --> 01:06:38,138
Arm.

549
01:06:38,336 --> 01:06:43,621
Catching him was my only chance to be hot again, get my super
-sexy ex back and prevent this from happening to someone else.

550
01:06:43,719 --> 01:06:46,557
So yeah, today was about as
much fun as a sandpaper dildo.

551
01:06:49,202 --> 01:06:50,963
#drive-by.

552
01:07:08,093 --> 01:07:11,032
Found out who our
friend in the red suit is.

553
01:07:12,010 --> 01:07:17,884
Fucking Wade Wilson. Suppose I'd wear
a mask, too, if I had a face like that.

554
01:07:17,982 --> 01:07:19,842
I only wish I'd heal the same.

555
01:07:23,367 --> 01:07:26,695
Still, we'll put him out of
our misery. On our terms.

556
01:07:28,394 --> 01:07:34,402
- Right. And when he heals?
- He can't. Not if there's nothing left of him to heal.

557
01:07:34,502 --> 01:07:39,407
You know, it's funny. I
almost missed the fucker.

558
01:07:40,409 --> 01:07:46,716
I like a challenge. But he's bad
for business. Now let's go find him.

559
01:07:51,422 --> 01:07:55,426
- Tylenol PM?
- It sticks back where you stuck the Bactine.

560
01:07:55,526 --> 01:08:02,435
I raided my stash of wisdom just to take a sec
and I am orbiting fucking Saturn right now.

561
01:08:05,038 --> 01:08:07,441
But I appreciate the gesture.

562
01:08:08,442 --> 01:08:12,447
Am I crazy? Or is
your hand really small?

563
01:08:12,547 --> 01:08:15,451
About the size of a KFC spork.

564
01:08:16,452 --> 01:08:22,960
I get why you're so pissy, but your mood's never gonna
brighten 'till you find this woman and tell her how you feel.

565
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:28,466
What do I keep telling you, Mrs. McGoo? She wouldn't
have me. If you could see me, you'd understand.

566
01:08:28,567 --> 01:08:32,971
- Looks aren't everything.
- Looks are everything! Ever heard David Beckham speak?

567
01:08:33,071 --> 01:08:38,979
It's like he mouth-sexed a can of helium. You think
Ryan Reynolds got this far on a superior acting method?

568
01:08:39,079 --> 01:08:40,981
- Love is blind, Wade.
- No...

569
01:08:41,482 --> 01:08:43,484
You're blind.

570
01:08:43,585 --> 01:08:46,488
So you're just gonna
lie there and whimper?

571
01:08:46,588 --> 01:08:52,093
No, I'm gonna wait 'till this arm plows through puberty
and then I'll come up with a whole, new Christmas day plan.

572
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:57,500
In the meantime, you might wanna leave
the room. I bet it feels huge in this hand.

573
01:08:58,502 --> 01:09:01,505
Go, go, go, go, go...

574
01:09:02,505 --> 01:09:07,312
So the doctor says, the bad news is you don't have
that long to live. So the patient says, how long do I have?

575
01:09:07,412 --> 01:09:10,515
The doctor says, five.
The guys says, five what?

576
01:09:10,616 --> 01:09:14,520
The doctor says, 4, 3, 2...

577
01:09:20,528 --> 01:09:23,130
Can I help you ladies?

578
01:09:25,533 --> 01:09:27,536
Oh, I do hope so.

579
01:09:30,539 --> 01:09:35,546
Now, I heard you might be able to point
me in the direction of a, a friend of mine.

580
01:09:35,646 --> 01:09:37,548
Name of Wade Wilson.

581
01:09:38,549 --> 01:09:41,552
Sorry, I don't know the name.

582
01:09:48,561 --> 01:09:51,434
Hey, you're not supposed
to be behind the bar.

583
01:09:54,568 --> 01:09:59,575
- I've seen this girl.
- This must be Vanessa. I've
heard so much about you.

584
01:10:03,579 --> 01:10:08,585
Sweetheart, you might wanna look around. This
isn't really the place to do something like that.

585
01:10:09,586 --> 01:10:13,591
Easy, Angel. Put
the little man down.

586
01:10:14,593 --> 01:10:17,596
- We have everything we need now.
- You sure?

587
01:10:18,598 --> 01:10:21,601
You don't want any clothes
that are not monochromatic?

588
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:25,338
There's a midnight showing of Blade II.

589
01:10:28,254 --> 01:10:31,169
Thanks for having my back, guys.

590
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:39,430
Wade, we have a fucking
problem, and by we, I mean you.

591
01:10:40,595 --> 01:10:45,746
I can't believe we're doing this. Is there
a word for half-afraid, half-angry?

592
01:10:45,844 --> 01:10:48,662
"Afrangry", I guess. Have you
decided what you're gonna say to her?

593
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:53,230
- Fuck me!
- Maybe not start with that.

594
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:04,211
Hey, coming on to our stage
right now, give it up for Chastity!

595
01:11:07,127 --> 01:11:11,986
- Or as I like to call her, Irony.
- I gotta find her fast, before numb nuts does.

596
01:11:12,084 --> 01:11:16,846
- How do you know she's in here?
- Some customer stalking that fox.

597
01:11:41,735 --> 01:11:45,746
Every time I see her,
it's like the first time.

598
01:11:46,248 --> 01:11:48,754
Especially from this angle.

599
01:12:11,815 --> 01:12:15,825
You can't buy love, but you
can rent it for three minutes.

600
01:12:18,833 --> 01:12:21,841
You weak motherfucker!

601
01:12:22,843 --> 01:12:27,857
C'mon. Get it together, this isn't
about you, this is about Vanessa.

602
01:12:31,867 --> 01:12:33,871
Here we go.

603
01:12:35,877 --> 01:12:37,882
Maximum effort.

604
01:12:40,890 --> 01:12:42,494
Vanessa!

605
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:50,917
Someone out back asking for you.
Something about... an old boyfriend?

606
01:13:16,985 --> 01:13:21,998
I knew it was you. 'Cause
we're weird curvy edges.

607
01:13:23,001 --> 01:13:25,006
Like a jigsaw puzzle.

608
01:13:35,032 --> 01:13:38,040
You have Wade Wilson to thank for this.

609
01:13:46,061 --> 01:13:51,075
- Hey, where did she go?
- I saw her head to the back. Go get her, tiger.

610
01:14:18,547 --> 01:14:20,151
Motherfucker!

611
01:14:20,151 --> 01:14:22,958
- Wade, Wade, Wade, Wade...
- Cunt! Chocolate---

612
01:14:23,158 --> 01:14:28,171
- Jiminy---- Fuck! Fuck!
- We can talk... or you can hit that...

613
01:14:33,185 --> 01:14:36,192
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Relax, relax. Okay...

614
01:14:36,192 --> 01:14:43,211
I'm gonna rip his motherfucking-- find
that, find it, or I'm gonna get angry.

615
01:14:45,217 --> 01:14:49,126
Here, this is Vanessa.
No, wait, it's Francis.

616
01:14:49,227 --> 01:14:52,235
- He wants you to come to him.
- What is that?

617
01:14:52,335 --> 01:14:58,250
That's the shit emoji. It's the turd with the smiling face and
the eyes. I thought it was chocolate yogurt for so long.

618
01:14:58,552 --> 01:15:01,258
- I need guns.
- Okay, which ones?

619
01:15:01,359 --> 01:15:04,267
- I need all the guns!
- All right, okay.

620
01:15:23,717 --> 01:15:28,731
- That's about 3000 rounds.
- And we all know what I can do with 12.

621
01:15:29,032 --> 01:15:32,340
Hey, hey, careful with that,
Ronnie Milsap, we're downrange.

622
01:15:33,343 --> 01:15:38,356
I was gonna spend the night assembling
the () but this is holding my interest.

623
01:15:38,457 --> 01:15:44,372
- I told you, we're going with the (), not the (),
get it thru your head or get outta Fucktown!
- Shit.

624
01:15:44,472 --> 01:15:48,382
- That's all the pieces in the house.
- No, no, no, come on. Let's go. Cough it up.

625
01:15:51,390 --> 01:15:54,399
- Down, down, down, down.
- Fuck you.

626
01:15:55,401 --> 01:15:58,409
25 cal. I like it.

627
01:16:00,314 --> 01:16:01,417
Wade...

628
01:16:02,419 --> 01:16:06,430
I'd go with you, but...
I don't wanna.

629
01:16:08,435 --> 01:16:11,443
Oh, listen, Al...

630
01:16:12,446 --> 01:16:17,459
If I never see you again, I want you
to know that I love you very much.

631
01:16:18,461 --> 01:16:25,479
And also, there's about 116 kilos of cocaine buried somewhere
in the apartment, right next to the cure for blindness.

632
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:27,485
Good luck.

633
01:16:31,495 --> 01:16:34,503
You wanna get fucked up?

634
01:16:43,026 --> 01:16:45,532
Put her down over here.

635
01:16:54,556 --> 01:16:56,561
Go on, then.

636
01:16:58,567 --> 01:17:04,582
- Thanks, dickless. And I mean you.
- You're a talker, too. You and Wade.

637
01:17:04,682 --> 01:17:09,596
I've been trying to tell you assholes you
got the wrong girl. My old boyfriend, he's dead.

638
01:17:09,696 --> 01:17:17,617
See, I thought that, too. But he keeps on
coming back. Like a cockroach, but uglier.

639
01:17:17,717 --> 01:17:25,137
Now, I may not feel, but he does. Let's see
how he fights with your head on the block.

640
01:17:32,656 --> 01:17:36,667
- Ripley! From Alien 3!
- Fuck, you're old.

641
01:17:37,670 --> 01:17:44,788
- Fake laugh! Hiding real pain! Go get Silver balls.
- You guys going for a bite? Early bird special?

642
01:17:44,988 --> 01:17:48,197
Like there's something wrong with eating
before sundown or saving money. No.

643
01:17:48,397 --> 01:17:52,709
You know that bad guy that
you let go? He's got my girl.

644
01:17:53,711 --> 01:17:57,471
- You're gonna help me get her back.
- Wade? Is that you?

645
01:17:57,572 --> 01:18:01,732
Yeah, it's me Deadpool, and I got
an offer that you can't refuse!

646
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:06,344
I'm gonna wait out here,
okay? It's a big house!

647
01:18:06,444 --> 01:18:11,758
It's funny that I only ever see 2 of you. It s almost
like, the studio couldn't afford another X-Man.

648
01:18:11,888 --> 01:18:17,202
And that, is why in my opinion, the
movie Cocoon, is pure pornography.

649
01:18:18,205 --> 01:18:22,216
- Who brought this twinkly man?
- Twinkly, but deadly.

650
01:18:22,316 --> 01:18:30,938
My chrome-penised friend back there, has agreed to do me this
solid. In exchange, I said I would consider joining his boy band.

651
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:34,247
- It's not boy band.
- Sure, it's not.

652
01:18:34,247 --> 01:18:43,271
- So, any luck winning Gita back?
- I tried to hold on tight, Mr. Pool, but Bandu
is more craftier and handsomer than me.

653
01:18:43,372 --> 01:18:46,279
Well, I think you're pretty darn cute.

654
01:18:51,292 --> 01:18:53,298
- Dopinder?
- Hmm?

655
01:18:54,902 --> 01:19:04,025
- What was that?
- That was........ Bandu, in the trunk?

656
01:19:04,126 --> 01:19:07,334
- Ban-who?
- My romantic rival, Bandu.

657
01:19:07,434 --> 01:19:14,353
He's tied up in the trunk. I'm doing as you said, DP, I plan to gut
him like a tandoori fish then dump his carcass on Gita's doorstep.

658
01:19:14,454 --> 01:19:19,366
I did not tell him to do that! Absolutely
not! We got lost in translation!

659
01:19:19,466 --> 01:19:23,678
Dopinder, this is no way to win Gita's
heart back! (I'm so proud of you.)

660
01:19:23,778 --> 01:19:27,086
Drop Bandu off safe
and gentle-like. (Kill him.)

661
01:19:27,187 --> 01:19:33,403
And then, win Gita back the old-fashioned
way, with your boyish charm! (Kidnap her.)

662
01:19:34,406 --> 01:19:36,411
He's super dead.

663
01:19:41,424 --> 01:19:45,434
- I presume a crisp high-five?
- For you? Ten!

664
01:19:45,936 --> 01:19:50,448
Okay, guys, let's get out there and make
a difference! (You know what to do.)

665
01:19:51,851 --> 01:19:53,456
Knock 'em dead, pool boy!

666
01:19:55,462 --> 01:19:58,067
Time to make the
chimi-fucking-changas.

667
01:19:59,170 --> 01:20:07,993
Not often a dude ruins your face, skullstomps your sanity,
grabs your baby mama and personally sees thru 4 of your 5 shittiest moments.

668
01:20:08,060 --> 01:20:12,465
Let's just say it's beginning
to look a lot like Christmas.

669
01:20:25,079 --> 01:20:28,483
Hey, where's your duffel bag?

670
01:20:51,507 --> 01:20:56,513
Goddammit! We'll do this the old-
fashioned way. With two swords..

671
01:20:57,613 --> 01:20:59,015
... and maximum effort.

672
01:20:59,115 --> 01:21:01,518
Cue the music.

673
01:21:16,534 --> 01:21:18,536
Wade Wilson!

674
01:21:19,538 --> 01:21:23,541
- What's my name?
- Ooh, I'mma fucking spell it out for 'ya.

675
01:21:25,544 --> 01:21:30,549
- Go get some.
- Superhero landing. She's gonna
do a superhero landing, wait for it!

676
01:21:34,554 --> 01:21:39,558
Superhero landing! You know, that's really hard
on your knees. Totally impractical, they all do it.

677
01:21:39,658 --> 01:21:44,263
You're a lovely lady but I'm saving myself
for Francis. That's why I brought him.

678
01:21:44,414 --> 01:21:48,567
I'd prefer not to hit a
woman, so please----

679
01:21:54,573 --> 01:21:57,577
I mean, that's why I brought her?

680
01:21:59,279 --> 01:22:04,585
Oh no. Finish your tweet. Just give us
a second. Here you go. Hash tag it.

681
01:22:05,585 --> 01:22:07,588
Go get her, tiger.

682
01:22:14,595 --> 01:22:18,599
I so pity the dude who
pressures her into prom sex.

683
01:22:18,699 --> 01:22:20,902
Alright then. Fire!

684
01:22:32,114 --> 01:22:33,805
Finish fucking her the fuck off!

685
01:22:34,016 --> 01:22:36,118
- Language, please.
- Suck a cock!

686
01:23:02,196 --> 01:23:05,950
Look away, child. Look away!

687
01:23:12,657 --> 01:23:17,663
- Wait! Wait!
- Cease fire! Cease fire!

688
01:23:17,763 --> 01:23:24,670
Fellas, hey, you only work for
that shit-spackled Muppet fart.

689
01:23:24,770 --> 01:23:33,479
So, I'mma give you a chance for y'all to lay down your firearms
in exchange for preferential, bordering on gentle, possibly...

690
01:23:33,679 --> 01:23:36,083
... even lover-like treatment.

691
01:23:37,684 --> 01:23:40,286
Fine! Commando!

692
01:24:52,363 --> 01:24:53,764
Teabag!

693
01:24:56,768 --> 01:25:00,171
- Bob?
- Wade?

694
01:25:00,371 --> 01:25:04,175
- Oh my God, I haven't seen you since, TGIFridays!
- Jacksonville. Fridays.

695
01:25:04,775 --> 01:25:09,380
What the hell! God!
Come here, you.

696
01:25:10,782 --> 01:25:17,790
How are the kids? Good? And Gail, is she still
fixing that tuna casserole? It's so good, but bad for...

697
01:25:24,797 --> 01:25:33,806
- Your... on the left... You are beautiful...
- That is so sweet! Thanks!

698
01:25:43,816 --> 01:25:47,821
Does he write you notes,
too? He's such a romantic.

699
01:25:47,921 --> 01:25:49,823
Don't worry, baby. I'm coming.

700
01:25:50,824 --> 01:25:52,126
Fire!

701
01:25:58,832 --> 01:26:02,837
Hey! Climb on.

702
01:26:51,889 --> 01:26:55,893
Motherfucker shoulda
worn his brown pants.

703
01:26:56,895 --> 01:27:02,501
- You were right, beautiful.
Red really is my color.
- Wade?

704
01:27:02,601 --> 01:27:06,555
Don't worry, baby. I'mma
get you outta that shitbox.

705
01:27:06,705 --> 01:27:10,909
- What better way to crawl back
inside that head of yours.
- Oh, you never left.

706
01:27:11,010 --> 01:27:14,914
- But you did, asshole!
- Deep breath, darling.

707
01:27:15,915 --> 01:27:20,921
No wait.... Wrong
choice of words.

708
01:27:21,921 --> 01:27:26,325
Well I hope they've blocked pain to your
every last nerve. 'Cause I'mma go looking!

709
01:27:27,727 --> 01:27:33,033
I hear you grow back body parts now, Wade.
When I'm finished, what's left to grow back you?

710
01:27:33,183 --> 01:27:36,937
Good one.... Yup.
That was a good one.

711
01:27:37,037 --> 01:27:42,442
Let's dance. And by "dance", I
mean let's try to kill each other.

712
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:42,006
- Fine. Fists.
- Sounds like your last Saturday night.

713
01:30:02,090 --> 01:30:06,095
Asshole!

714
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:05,596
- Hang in there, baby. I got you.
- Wade!

715
01:31:07,611 --> 01:31:10,332
I got a plan. You're
not gonna like it.

716
01:31:19,701 --> 01:31:22,723
Shit, shit, shit!

717
01:31:26,753 --> 01:31:30,783
Don't worry! I'm
totally on top of this.

718
01:31:45,896 --> 01:31:50,934
Dammit! Maximum effort!

719
01:32:33,248 --> 01:32:35,263
Thanks.

720
01:32:39,293 --> 01:24:38,722
Just take it slow.

721
01:32:51,786 --> 01:32:55,111
Oh, my God! That was so awe---

722
01:33:28,055 --> 01:33:34,503
- Me and you, are headed
to fix this butter face!
- What?

723
01:33:35,712 --> 01:33:39,037
You sure are a fucking idiot.

724
01:33:39,239 --> 01:33:45,384
Did you really think
there was a cure, for that?

725
01:33:45,787 --> 01:33:49,817
- What?
- You heard me.

726
01:33:49,918 --> 01:33:52,839
No, no!

727
01:33:59,892 --> 01:34:07,250
So, you mean to say...
After all this, you can't fix me?

728
01:34:07,650 --> 01:34:09,170
It sounds even
stupider when you say it.

729
01:34:09,870 --> 01:34:14,510
Like the kind of stupid who admits he can't
do the one thing I'm keeping him alive for?

730
01:34:18,540 --> 01:34:20,550
Any last words?

731
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:25,590
- What's my name?
- Who fucking cares!

732
01:34:25,690 --> 01:34:27,200
Wade!

733
01:34:27,610 --> 01:34:31,640
- Four or five moments.
- I'm sorry?

734
01:34:31,740 --> 01:34:36,670
- Four or five moments, that's all it takes.
- To...?

735
01:34:36,770 --> 01:34:38,690
Be a hero.

736
01:34:40,100 --> 01:34:49,570
Everyone thinks it's a full-time job. Wake up a hero.
Brush your teeth a hero. Go to work a hero. Not true.

737
01:34:49,770 --> 01:34:54,810
Over a lifetime, there are only 4
or 5 moments that really matter.

738
01:34:54,910 --> 01:34:57,630
Moments when you're offered a choice.

739
01:34:57,830 --> 01:35:01,860
To make a sacrifice, conquer
a flaw, save a friend...

740
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:05,890
... spare an enemy.

741
01:35:05,990 --> 01:35:10,930
In these moments, everything else falls away.

742
01:35:11,030 --> 01:35:15,960
The way the world sees us.
The way we---

743
01:35:54,110 --> 01:35:59,050
- What the fuck am I gonna tell her?
- Well, you better figure it out.

744
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:05,100
I can't even tell you... I deserve that...
that too.. No, no, no, maybe not the nethers.

745
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:06,620
Start talking!

746
01:36:09,030 --> 01:36:16,280
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. For
everything. I'm sorry for leaving,

747
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:23,740
- I'm sorry for not cowboying up sooner...
It's been a rough couple of years.
- Rough?

748
01:36:29,780 --> 01:36:34,820
I live in a crackhouse.
With a family of 12...

749
01:36:36,230 --> 01:36:40,860
Every night we spoon for warmth, everybody
fights for Noelle. She's the fattest.

750
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:46,910
There is nothing that we don't share.
Floor space, dental floss, even condoms.

751
01:36:54,970 --> 01:36:57,670
So you live in a house?

752
01:37:06,050 --> 01:37:09,070
I should've come
and found you sooner.

753
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:15,120
But everything under this mask,
he ain't the same one you remember.

754
01:37:19,150 --> 01:37:21,160
You made this mask?

755
01:37:40,310 --> 01:37:45,650
And this one. In case
the other fell off.

756
01:37:50,380 --> 01:37:56,430
Like a band-aid. Just... Audi 5000.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

757
01:37:56,530 --> 01:37:57,450
Are you sure?

758
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:01,970
I'm sure.

759
01:38:12,050 --> 01:38:15,070
- Wow.
- Yeah.

760
01:38:22,220 --> 01:38:28,260
After a brief adjustment period,
and a bunch of drinks..

761
01:38:29,350 --> 01:38:31,350
It's a face...

762
01:38:37,300 --> 01:38:40,320
I'd be happy to sit on.

763
01:38:47,180 --> 01:38:53,530
But I'm not the same underneath
this suit either. Super-penis.

764
01:38:53,830 --> 01:38:57,760
Come on, Wade, language.
Young one is present.

765
01:38:58,770 --> 01:39:02,800
What are you still doing ---- Get
outta here, go make yourself useful.

766
01:39:02,900 --> 01:39:07,930
You, go be a really big brother to someone.
Tell Beast to stop shitting on my lawn.

767
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:13,780
And you, chicken noodle. Nothing
Compares 2 U. Sinead O'Connor, 1990. Sorry.

768
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:19,920
- That's all right. You're cool.
- What in the ass?

769
01:39:20,020 --> 01:39:26,980
- That was not mean! I'm proud of you!
- We will make an X-Man of you yet, Wade.

770
01:39:27,080 --> 01:39:33,020
You know, for a second there, it felt like we were 3 mini
lion robots coming together to form one super robot.

771
01:39:33,070 --> 01:39:35,770
- This was stupid.
- Yeah.

772
01:39:38,680 --> 01:39:43,520
And now, for the moment
I've all been waiting for.

773
01:39:46,420 --> 01:39:48,360
Come here.

774
01:39:57,070 --> 01:40:00,950
WHAM! As promised.

775
01:40:12,570 --> 01:40:16,440
See? You don't need to be
a superhero to get the girl.

776
01:40:17,410 --> 01:40:20,310
The right girl will bring
out the hero in you.

777
01:40:20,410 --> 01:40:28,350
Now, let's finish this epic wide shot, pull out, here we go...
Looks nice, not gonna be the only thing that's pulling out tonight.

778
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:35,340
Who doesn't love a happy ending, huh? Until next
time, this is your friendly neighborhood Pool guy singing...

779
01:42:33,250 --> 01:42:35,220
You're still here.

780
01:42:37,200 --> 01:42:40,450
It's over! Go home!

781
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:46,660
Oh, you're expecting a teaser for Deadpool 2.
Well, we don't have that kind of money.

782
01:42:46,860 --> 01:42:54,940
What were you expecting, Sam Jackson'll
show up?  Eye patch? Saucy leather? Go, go.

783
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:02,820
Oh! But I can tell you one thing
and it's a bit of a secret.

784
01:43:02,820 --> 01:43:09,720
In the sequel, we're gonna have Cable. Amazing character.
Bionic arm, time-travel. We have no idea who to cast yet,

785
01:43:09,820 --> 01:43:12,290
but it could be anybody. Just
take a big guy with a flat top.

786
01:43:12,390 --> 01:43:18,600
Could be Mel Gibson, Dolph Lundgren, Keira Knightley.
She's got range, who knows? Anyway, big secret.

787
01:43:18,790 --> 01:43:24,120
And don't leave your garbage rotting
around. It's a total dick move. Go.



9999
