1
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:58,205
I'm kinda lonesome back here.

2
00:02:59,704 --> 00:03:05,995
- Little help...
- Just... I have to keep my hands on the wheel.

3
00:03:07,065 --> 00:03:08,063
Excuse me!

4
00:03:10,683 --> 00:03:13,179
- Dopinder.
- Pool. Dead.

5
00:03:15,677 --> 00:03:18,550
- Nice!
- Smells good, no?

6
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,423
Not the daffodil daydream. The girl.

7
00:03:20,623 --> 00:03:24,118
Yes. Gita. She is quite lovely.

8
00:03:24,218 --> 00:03:28,013
She would have made me
a very agreeable wife. But...

9
00:03:28,113 --> 00:03:31,908
Gita's heart has been
stolen by my cousin, Bandu.

10
00:03:32,108 --> 00:03:36,502
He is as dishonorable
as he is attractive.

11
00:03:37,101 --> 00:03:41,495
Dopinder, I'm starting to think there's
a reason I'm in this cab today.

12
00:03:41,695 --> 00:03:45,589
- Yes, sir, you called for it, remember?
- No, my slender, brown friend. Love...

13
00:03:46,089 --> 00:03:51,582
... is a beautiful thing. When you find it,
the whole world tastes like daffodil daydream.

14
00:03:51,681 --> 00:03:55,376
So you gotta hold on to love. Tight!

15
00:03:55,576 --> 00:03:59,571
And never let go. Don't make the
same mistakes I did, got it?

16
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,665
Or else the whole world tastes
like Mama June after hot yoga.

17
00:04:04,065 --> 00:04:06,462
Sir, what does Ms Mama June taste like?

18
00:04:06,661 --> 00:04:12,553
Like two hobos fucking in a shoe filled with piss.
I can go all day, Dopinder. The point is it's bad.

19
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:16,848
Why the fancy red suit, Mr. Pool?

20
00:04:17,047 --> 00:04:21,442
Oh, that's because it's Christmas day, Dopinder,
and I'm after someone on my naughty list.

21
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:28,532
I've been waiting, 1 year, 3 weeks, 6 days and---
14 minutes to make him fix what he did to me.

22
00:04:28,605 --> 00:04:32,600
- And what did he do to you, Mr. Pool?
- This shit.

23
00:04:34,597 --> 00:04:35,496
Boo!

24
00:04:55,568 --> 00:04:59,563
- They won't disappoint.
- They'd better not!

25
00:04:59,662 --> 00:05:02,958
- What about next month's shipment?
- There won't be one.

26
00:05:03,717 --> 00:05:06,024
You're not the only
one with a war to win.

27
00:05:06,553 --> 00:05:08,750
That won't do.

28
00:05:10,548 --> 00:05:15,241
See, we've had this small
disruption to our supply trade.

29
00:05:18,592 --> 00:05:22,586
We'd appreciate your patience.

30
00:05:23,585 --> 00:05:25,183
Okay...

31
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:27,108
We'll deliver in full
the following month.

32
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,998
Pleasure doing business with you.

33
00:05:35,994 --> 00:05:37,991
Fucking mutant!

34
00:05:47,978 --> 00:05:50,974
Shit! I forgot my ammo bag!

35
00:05:51,073 --> 00:05:55,468
- Shall we turn back?
- No time. Fuck it. I got this.

36
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:59,962
9, 10, 11, 12 bullets.
Or bust. Right here!

37
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:04,356
That's $27.50.

38
00:06:04,556 --> 00:06:08,450
I never carry a wallet while I'm
working. Ruins the lines of my suit.

39
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:11,619
- But how 'bout a crisp high-five?
- Okay.

40
00:06:11,619 --> 00:06:13,034
Merry Christmas!

41
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:16,664
And a convivial Tuesday
and April to you, Pool!

42
00:06:36,845 --> 00:06:39,642
Oh! Oh, hello!

43
00:06:39,841 --> 00:06:45,834
I know, right? Whose balls did I
have to fondle to get my very own movie?

44
00:06:45,933 --> 00:06:50,727
I can't tell you, but it does rhyme
with "Pulverine". And lemme tell you...

45
00:06:50,927 --> 00:06:54,821
He's got a nice pair of
smooth criminals down under!

46
00:06:55,121 --> 00:06:58,866
Anyway. I got places to be.
A face to fix. And, oh!

47
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:01,113
Bad guys to kill.

48
00:07:06,805 --> 00:07:08,803
Maximum effort.

49
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,388
Cock shot!

50
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,774
Rich! Corinthian leather!

51
00:07:30,773 --> 00:07:33,370
I'm looking for Francis!

52
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,467
Have you seen this man?

53
00:07:44,754 --> 00:07:47,252
Yanking, yanking!

54
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:21,406
I've never said this, but don't swallow.

55
00:08:42,676 --> 00:08:46,271
Shit. Did I leave the stove on?

56
00:09:03,548 --> 00:09:05,446
Now, breaking news.

57
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:09,640
A multi-car collision turned shots fired
on the crosstown expressway this morning.

58
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:14,334
Gridlock has kept police from the scene.
Residents are advised to remain in their homes.

59
00:09:14,634 --> 00:09:17,630
The assailant appears to be
armed, dangerous, and wearing a...

60
00:09:17,729 --> 00:09:20,625
Red suit. Deadpool.

61
00:09:20,725 --> 00:09:23,821
Negasonic! Come. We have mission.

62
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,517
Colossus, wait up.

63
00:09:26,618 --> 00:09:30,113
I've given Deadpool
every chance to join us.

64
00:09:30,313 --> 00:09:35,106
But he'd rather act like
a child. A heavily armed child.

65
00:09:35,306 --> 00:09:39,001
When will he grow up and see
benefits of becoming X-Man?

66
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,296
Which benefits, the matching unitards?
The house that blows up every few years?

67
00:09:43,595 --> 00:09:46,590
Please. House blowing up builds character.

68
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:51,984
You ate breakfast, yes? Breakfast
is most important meal of day.

69
00:09:52,183 --> 00:09:56,278
Here. Protein bar. Good for bones.

70
00:09:56,477 --> 00:09:59,074
Deadpool may try to break yours.

71
00:10:26,537 --> 00:10:28,135
Hey!

72
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,615
Wait! You may be wondering
why the red suit.

73
00:10:42,814 --> 00:10:45,411
Well that's so bad guys
can't see me bleed.

74
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:48,407
This guy's got the right idea.
He wore the brown pants.

75
00:10:50,504 --> 00:10:54,199
Fine! I only have 12 bullets, so
you're gonna have to share!

76
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,997
Let's count 'em down!

77
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:20,953
Shit, motherfucker!

78
00:11:21,053 --> 00:11:22,854
Ten! Shit.

79
00:11:23,055 --> 00:11:27,659
Nine! Fuck.
Eight. Shit-fuck!

80
00:11:30,861 --> 00:11:32,663
Bad Deadpool.

81
00:11:33,464 --> 00:11:36,065
Seven. Good Deadpool!

82
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,886
Someone's not counting.

83
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:01,087
Six!

84
00:12:27,107 --> 00:12:29,108
Four...

85
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,111
Gotcha!

86
00:12:33,111 --> 00:12:35,614
Right up main street!

87
00:12:39,117 --> 00:12:42,820
Three, two! Stupid!
Worth it.

88
00:13:08,141 --> 00:13:11,143
I'm touching myself tonight.

89
00:13:11,244 --> 00:13:14,146
Francis! Francis!

90
00:13:16,147 --> 00:13:20,751
What the shitbiscuit!
Where you at, Francis?

91
00:13:29,158 --> 00:13:31,160
You're not Francis!

92
00:13:38,165 --> 00:13:41,169
Really? Rolling up the sleeves?

93
00:13:50,175 --> 00:13:58,881
You're probably thinking, "my boyfriend said this was a
superhero movie but that guy in the red suit just turned
that other guy into a fucking

94
00:13:58,982 --> 00:14:02,785
Well, I may be super. But I'm no hero.

95
00:14:03,185 --> 00:14:07,789
Anyhow, technically, this is a murder. But some
of the best love stories start with a murder.

96
00:14:07,989 --> 00:14:12,043
And that's exactly what this is:
a love story. And to tell it right,

97
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:16,997
I gotta take you back to long before
I squeeze this ass into red spandex.

98
00:14:17,197 --> 00:14:22,802
Look, would it help if I slow it down
for you? I didn't order the pizza.

99
00:14:23,001 --> 00:14:26,105
Is this 7348 Redledge Drive?

100
00:14:26,205 --> 00:14:31,008
- Are you Mr. Merchant?
- The Mr. Merchant who didn't order the fucking pie!

101
00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:33,811
- Who placed the call?
- I did!

102
00:14:35,211 --> 00:14:40,816
Pineapple and olive? Sweet and salty!

103
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:43,819
The fuck are you? The fuck
are you doing in my crib?

104
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:47,422
- Is that bread crust? Don't move!
- God, I hope not.

105
00:14:47,522 --> 00:14:51,225
Look, is this about that
poker game? I told Howie...

106
00:14:53,227 --> 00:14:56,229
- Just take whatever you want.
- Thanks!

107
00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:00,432
Sir, before you do anything to him,
do you mind if I get a big tip?

108
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:05,237
- Jeremy, is it? Wade Wilson.
- Yeah.

109
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:08,940
That is a no go on the tip-aroo, Jer.

110
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,243
I'm not here for him.
I'm here for you.

111
00:15:13,243 --> 00:15:18,047
- I dodged a big-time bullet on that one!
- Not, out of the woods yet.

112
00:15:18,247 --> 00:15:23,051
You need to seriously ease up on the
bedazzling. They're jeans, not a chandelier.

113
00:15:23,152 --> 00:15:25,253
P.S. I'm keeping your wallet.
You did kind of give it to me.

114
00:15:25,454 --> 00:15:29,957
- Just look, man, can I have my---
- I will shoot your fucking cat.

115
00:15:30,257 --> 00:15:32,258
I don't really know what that
means, I don't have a cat.

116
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:35,262
Then whose kitty litter did I just shit in?

117
00:15:38,264 --> 00:15:39,565
Anywho...

118
00:15:39,866 --> 00:15:44,269
Tell me something. What situation
isn't improved by pizza?

119
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:48,872
Do you happen to know a Megan
Orflosky? Get that right? Orflovsky?

120
00:15:51,273 --> 00:15:53,976
'Cause she knows you. Jeremy...

121
00:15:54,276 --> 00:15:57,679
I belong to a group of guys who
take a dime to beat a fella down.

122
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:02,483
And little Megan, she's not made of
money, but lucky for her, I got a soft spot.

123
00:16:03,283 --> 00:16:05,285
- I'm.....
- A stalker.

124
00:16:05,385 --> 00:16:10,289
Threats hurt, Jer. Though not
nearly as badly as serrated steel.

125
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:16,294
- So keep away from Megan. Cool?
- Yes, sir.

126
00:16:16,394 --> 00:16:19,297
- And we're done.
- Wait, we are?

127
00:16:19,397 --> 00:16:23,100
Totally done. You should've seen your face!

128
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,302
- I didn't know what to do, I was so scared...
- Soft spot, remember?

129
00:16:27,303 --> 00:16:33,308
Even look in her general direction again and you will learn
in the worst of ways that I have some hard spots, too.

130
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:36,311
That came out wrong.

131
00:16:37,311 --> 00:16:39,313
Or did it?

132
00:16:51,323 --> 00:16:53,325
Megan.

133
00:16:55,327 --> 00:16:58,529
You've heard the last
of Jeremy. He's sorry.

134
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:01,331
No friggin' way.

135
00:17:05,335 --> 00:17:08,337
Should've brought my roller blades.
Show these kids how it's done.

136
00:17:08,538 --> 00:17:11,339
And that's why we do it.
But mostly the money.

137
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,341
Hey. Think you can
fuck up my step dad?

138
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:16,344
If I can give the guy a pavement
facial, it's 'cause he's earned it.

139
00:17:16,644 --> 00:17:18,346
Hey, wait.

140
00:17:19,346 --> 00:17:23,349
- You're my hero.
- No, no, no, no, no. That, I ain't.

141
00:17:25,352 --> 00:17:30,155
Nope. Never will be.
- Fuck you, Wade.

142
00:17:30,255 --> 00:17:33,358
I'm just a bad guy who gets
paid to fuck up worse guys.

143
00:17:34,358 --> 00:17:39,363
Welcome to Sister Margaret's.
It's like a job fair for mercenaries.

144
00:17:39,463 --> 00:17:44,066
Think of us as really fucked up tooth fairies
except we knock out the teeth and take the cash.

145
00:17:44,366 --> 00:17:49,370
You'd best hope we never
see your name on a gold card.
(Buck! Liefeld.)

146
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:52,373
- Hey, Wade!
- Wade Wilson. Patron Saint of the Pitiful.

147
00:17:52,473 --> 00:17:55,375
- What can I do for you?
- I'd love a blowjob.

148
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:59,678
- Oh, God, me too.
- The drink. With snuggle. But first...

149
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:05,383
- Hey, I ain't taking any babysitting money,
make sure that gets back to Miss...
- Orlovsky?

150
00:18:06,384 --> 00:18:08,385
- You sure?
- Hmm.

151
00:18:08,486 --> 00:18:12,189
For a merc, you're pretty warm-blooded.
Bet you let the kid off easy, too.

152
00:18:12,389 --> 00:18:19,395
He's not a bad kid. Just a little light stalking. I was way
worse when I was his age, travelling to exotic places...

153
00:18:19,495 --> 00:18:23,399
Baghdad, Mogadishu, Jacksonville,
meeting new and exciting people. And then..

154
00:18:23,499 --> 00:18:28,703
Killing them. Yeah, I've seen your instagram.
So what were special forces doing in Jacksonville?

155
00:18:28,903 --> 00:18:32,406
That's classified. They
have wonderful TGIFridays!

156
00:18:32,505 --> 00:18:36,409
Alright, kahlua, baileys
and whipped cream.

157
00:18:36,509 --> 00:18:38,411
I give you, a blowjob. I'm---

158
00:18:38,511 --> 00:18:41,413
- Why do you make me make that?
-  Kelly, Kelly, Kelly, Kelly...

159
00:18:41,513 --> 00:18:45,716
Take that over there to Buck, please and
tell him it's from Booth. Little foreplay.

160
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:50,420
- Remind me what good will come of this?
- I don't take the shits, I just disturb them.

161
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,423
What you want?

162
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:59,428
- Cheers. To your health.
- Fuck you.

163
00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:02,430
That's a new stool.

164
00:19:07,435 --> 00:19:09,436
Stay the fuck down.

165
00:19:13,439 --> 00:19:15,541
Alright, move, move, move, move.

166
00:19:15,641 --> 00:19:16,642
Buck, go rest.

167
00:19:23,448 --> 00:19:25,449
He's still breathing.

168
00:19:27,451 --> 00:19:31,455
Nobody wins today. Nice try, Wade.

169
00:19:31,555 --> 00:19:34,456
You got me. I picked Booth in
the dead pool. Who did you pick?

170
00:19:35,457 --> 00:19:40,461
- You know, Wade, about that....
- No. You did not bet on me to die.

171
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:47,266
You bet on me to die. Wow. Motherfucker,
you're the world's worst friend.

172
00:19:47,466 --> 00:19:52,471
Well, joke's on you. I'm living to 102.
And then die. At the city of Detroit.

173
00:19:52,571 --> 00:19:56,274
Sorry. I wanted to win money.
I never win anything.

174
00:19:56,474 --> 00:20:00,477
- Whatever. Soldiers of fortune, drink's on me!
- Yeah!

175
00:20:01,478 --> 00:20:03,480
Domestic! Nothing imported.

176
00:20:05,482 --> 00:20:07,884
Woah, woah, woah. Baby...

177
00:20:08,484 --> 00:20:10,485
Are you sure you wanna
shoot your whole wad?

178
00:20:13,489 --> 00:20:15,490
Tight.

179
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,991
- Vanessa.
- Wade.

180
00:20:18,492 --> 00:20:21,495
What's a nice place like
you doing in a girl like this?

181
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,496
I'd hit that.

182
00:20:24,498 --> 00:20:28,501
Buck, you'd best apologize
before--- yeah. That.

183
00:20:28,601 --> 00:20:31,503
- Say the magic words, fat Gandalf.
- I'm sorry.

184
00:20:31,603 --> 00:20:35,507
- Breathe through the nose.
- I don't have a filter between my brain and my...

185
00:20:35,606 --> 00:20:39,510
Okay, hey. Hakuna
his tatas, he's sorry!

186
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:44,514
- Get outta here. Go cast a spell.
- Hey, hands off the merchandise.

187
00:20:45,514 --> 00:20:49,518
Merchandise, huh. So you...

188
00:20:49,618 --> 00:20:52,520
- Fun fuzzies for money?
- Yup.

189
00:20:52,621 --> 00:20:56,324
- Rough childhood?
- Rougher than yours. Daddy left before I was born.

190
00:20:56,523 --> 00:20:59,527
Daddy left before I was conceived.

191
00:20:59,627 --> 00:21:02,529
- Ever had a cigarette put out on your skin?
- Where else do you put one out?

192
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:05,331
- I was molested.
- Me, too. Uncle.

193
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:11,536
- Uncles. They took turns.
- I watched my own birthday party through the keyhole
of a locked closet which also happens to be my...

194
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:15,539
Your bedroom. Lucky. I
slept in a dishwasher box.

195
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:22,845
You had a dishwasher. I didn't even know sleep. It was
pretty much 24/7 ball kegs, brownie mix and clown porn.

196
00:21:25,547 --> 00:21:27,548
Who would do such a thing?

197
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:32,553
Hopefully, you. Later tonight?

198
00:21:35,555 --> 00:21:42,560
What can I get for 275 dollars
and a yogurt rewards card?

199
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,564
Baby, about 48 minutes of
whatever the fuck you want.

200
00:21:46,564 --> 00:21:49,566
And a low-fat dessert.

201
00:21:55,572 --> 00:21:58,574
Did she just put a gift
card in your mouth?

202
00:21:59,575 --> 00:22:02,577
It's time to put
balls in holes.

203
00:22:02,677 --> 00:22:05,580
- You said whatever I want.
- I get it.

204
00:22:06,581 --> 00:22:11,585
- You love ski ball. Apparently more than you love vagina.
- That's a tough call.

205
00:22:11,885 --> 00:22:18,591
I just wanna get to know the real you. Not the short-
shorted 2-dimensional sex object peddled by Hollywood.

206
00:22:19,592 --> 00:22:21,593
Balls in holes.

207
00:22:22,594 --> 00:22:25,596
- Prepare to lose tragically.
- Bring it, big man.

208
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:37,606
A limited edition Voltron: Defender
of the Universe ring, por favor.

209
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,608
Okay. Here you go.
A limited edition Voltron: Defender
of the Universe ring, por favor.

210
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,611
I had this sucker for a while.

211
00:22:42,711 --> 00:22:45,113
- And I will take the pencil eraser.
- Okay.

212
00:22:45,613 --> 00:22:52,619
You are now the proud protector of the planet Arus.
And you, can erase stuff. Written in pencil.

213
00:22:52,719 --> 00:22:57,623
- Milady.
- I hate to break it to you,
but your 48 minutes are up.

214
00:22:58,123 --> 00:23:00,625
How many more minutes
could I get for this?

215
00:23:00,725 --> 00:23:05,630
FYI, 5 mini lion bots come
together to form 1 superbot.

216
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:12,935
- 5 mini lion bots? 3 minutes.
- Deal. What do we do with the remaining 2:37?

217
00:23:13,136 --> 00:23:14,136
Cuddle?

218
00:23:18,639 --> 00:23:22,642
- How long can we keep this up?
- All year?

219
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:34,653
Happy Valentines' Day.

220
00:23:40,657 --> 00:23:44,660
- Happy Chinese New Year.
- Year of the Dog.

221
00:23:49,665 --> 00:23:54,669
Relax... and happy
International Women's Day.

222
00:24:03,676 --> 00:24:05,678
Happy Lenten.

223
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:14,685
- Wade!
- Sorry. Happy Halloween!

224
00:24:22,692 --> 00:24:25,694
Happy Thanksgiving.

225
00:24:26,695 --> 00:24:28,697
I love you.

226
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,703
If your left leg is Thanksgiving,
and your right leg is Christmas...

227
00:24:36,303 --> 00:24:39,706
Can I visit you
between the holidays?

228
00:24:39,806 --> 00:24:42,709
That sweater is terrible!

229
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,711
But red looks good on you.

230
00:24:45,811 --> 00:24:48,713
Red's your color. Mine's like
the bloodshot in your eyes.

231
00:24:49,676 --> 00:24:51,568
- Listen. I've been thinking.
- Really?

232
00:24:53,261 --> 00:24:56,248
- 'Bout why we're so good together.
- Why is that?

233
00:24:57,244 --> 00:25:01,226
Your crazy matches
my crazy. Bigtime.

234
00:25:02,222 --> 00:25:06,205
And we're like 2 jigsaw
pieces. Weird curvy edges?

235
00:25:06,303 --> 00:25:10,186
- You put them together and you
can see the picture on top.
- Right.

236
00:25:11,182 --> 00:25:15,165
Wade... There's something I've
been meaning to ask you.

237
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:18,152
But only because you haven't
gotten around to asking me.

238
00:25:19,148 --> 00:25:21,138
Will you...

239
00:25:22,135 --> 00:25:25,121
- Stick it up my---
- ...Marry me?

240
00:25:26,117 --> 00:25:28,108
Uh... Jinx?

241
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,090
- Where were you hiding that?
- Nowhere.

242
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:35,475
- They said 1-month salary, so ...
- You mean...

243
00:25:35,674 --> 00:25:38,065
- I do.
- That's my line.

244
00:25:41,052 --> 00:25:44,735
- I love you, Wade Wilson.
- You're supposed to... So that's a...

245
00:25:45,034 --> 00:25:47,026
- Yes!
- Woo! Yes!

246
00:25:50,012 --> 00:25:52,004
I feel just like a little girl!

247
00:25:56,982 --> 00:26:02,956
- What if I just held on and never let go?
- Just ride the bitch's back like Yoda on Luke.

248
00:26:03,055 --> 00:26:06,938
- Star Wars jokes!
- Empire!

249
00:26:07,935 --> 00:26:10,921
Jesus Christ, it's like I
made you in a computer!

250
00:26:16,895 --> 00:26:18,886
Perfect.

251
00:26:22,869 --> 00:26:25,856
Pee break. Shake it, yeah.

252
00:26:30,835 --> 00:26:32,826
Here's the thing:

253
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:37,804
Life is an endless series of train wrecks with
only brief commercial-like breaks of happiness.

254
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,783
This had been the
ultimate commercial break.

255
00:26:43,777 --> 00:26:47,760
Which meant it was time to return,
to our regularly scheduled programme.

256
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:50,747
- What the fu.....
- Oh my God, Wade!

257
00:26:56,721 --> 00:27:01,700
You're clowning. You're
not clowning. I sense clowns.

258
00:27:02,196 --> 00:27:05,681
People react to news of late-
stage cancer differently.

259
00:27:05,782 --> 00:27:10,660
There are certainly options we can look into.
New drugs are being developed every day.

260
00:27:13,647 --> 00:27:18,625
So what do we do? Surely,
there is something we can do.

261
00:27:18,725 --> 00:27:24,898
My Uncle Ivan was diagnosed with Thyroid cancer and
there were all these experimental drugs from Germany...

262
00:27:25,097 --> 00:27:28,581
Vanessa's already working on plan
A, B, all the way through Z.

263
00:27:29,644 --> 00:27:35,833
Me? I'm memorizing the details of her
face. Like it's the first time I'm seeing it.

264
00:27:36,233 --> 00:27:38,628
- Or the last...
- Mr. Wilson, Mr. Wilson?

265
00:27:40,624 --> 00:27:46,614
Take your time to process this. It's
important not to do anything rash.

266
00:27:57,593 --> 00:28:02,585
Now, if I were a 200 pound sack of assholes
named Francis, where would I hide?

267
00:28:28,537 --> 00:28:36,523
"A hush falls over the crowd as rookie sensation Wade W.
Wilson out of Regina, Saskatchewan, lines up the shot."

268
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,517
"His form looks good."

269
00:28:41,513 --> 00:28:46,005
"And that's why Regina
rhymes with fun."

270
00:28:46,204 --> 00:28:50,795
"Ladies and gentlemen, what you're
witnessing is sweet, dick-kicking revenge!"

271
00:28:51,494 --> 00:28:55,487
"Giving him the business! Incoming!"

272
00:28:55,587 --> 00:28:59,480
"This is taking unsportsman-like
conduct to a whole new level!"

273
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:08,263
Looking good, Francis. Well-rested.
Like you've been pitching, not catching.

274
00:29:08,463 --> 00:29:11,457
Ringing any bells? No?

275
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:17,447
How 'bout now?

276
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,435
Wade fucking Wilson.

277
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:30,422
- Well, hello, gorgeous.
- Yeah, like I got bit by a radioactive Shar Pei.

278
00:29:30,523 --> 00:29:35,414
And whose fault is that, huh, Francis? Time
to undo what you did to this butter face.

279
00:29:35,414 --> 00:29:40,405
You should thank me. Apparently, I've made
you immortal. I'm actually quite jealous.

280
00:29:40,504 --> 00:29:43,898
Yeah, but this ain't a
life worth living, is it? Now...

281
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:50,255
I'm about to do to you what Limp
Bizkit did to music in the late 90's.

282
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:53,258
Dad?

283
00:29:56,261 --> 00:30:00,265
I think we can all agree that shit just went
sideways in the most colossal way.

284
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:03,868
Well, maybe not the most.

285
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:07,772
Now this, is my most prized possession.

286
00:30:08,272 --> 00:30:11,776
- Wham?
- No, no, no, no. WHAM!

287
00:30:12,035 --> 00:30:15,279
Make It Big is the album that George and
Andy earned the exclamation point.

288
00:30:15,379 --> 00:30:19,283
So, am I supposed to just
smile and wave you out the door?

289
00:30:19,383 --> 00:30:22,285
Think of it like spring cleaning.
Only if spring was death.

290
00:30:22,385 --> 00:30:26,289
God, if I had a nickel for everytime I
spanked at the Bernadette Peters.

291
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:30,326
Sounds like you have.
Bernadette is not going...

292
00:30:30,351 --> 00:30:33,319
...anywhere, because you're
not going anywhere.

293
00:30:33,963 --> 00:30:35,264
- Drink.
- You're right.

294
00:30:35,465 --> 00:30:38,968
Cancer's only in my liver, lungs, prostate
and brain. All things I can live without.

295
00:30:40,969 --> 00:30:46,874
You belong here at home. Surrounded by your
Voltron, and your Bernadette and your me.

296
00:30:46,975 --> 00:30:51,979
Listen, we both know
that cancer is a shit show.

297
00:34:06,675 --> 00:34:09,777
Not a good one, like Slapchop,
more Shakeweighty.

298
00:34:09,976 --> 00:34:14,980
The world needs extraordinary soldiers.
We won't just make you better.

299
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:18,182
We will make you better than better.

300
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:21,259
A superhero.

301
00:34:21,283 --> 00:34:26,010
Look, Agent Smith, I tried the
hero business and it left a mark.

302
00:34:26,086 --> 00:34:28,988
But if I ever hit fuck
-it, I'll look you up.

303
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:31,790
Oh. Shit.

304
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:35,992
We're within 500 yards of the school.
So you may wanna, you know...

305
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:40,995
His drink's on him.

306
00:34:45,998 --> 00:34:47,999
What'd he say?

307
00:35:09,332 --> 00:35:10,750
Hey, what's going on?

308
00:35:11,846 --> 00:35:16,449
Hey, sorry. I had a
Liam Neeson nightmare.

309
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:20,751
I dreamt I kidnapped his daughter
and he just wasn't having it.

310
00:35:30,757 --> 00:35:32,758
They made 3 of those movies.

311
00:35:33,759 --> 00:35:36,760
At some point, you'd have to
wonder if he's just a bad parent.

312
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:54,071
The worst part about cancer
isn't what it does to you.

313
00:35:54,772 --> 00:35:56,773
But what it does to
the people you love.

314
00:35:58,774 --> 00:36:04,778
Who knew if this guy could save my life? But I
knew there's only one way that I could save hers.

315
00:36:07,779 --> 00:36:10,371
Isn't that what superheroes do?

316
00:36:24,083 --> 00:36:28,085
Okay. Let's pro/con
this superhero thing.

317
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:34,889
Pro: they pull down a gaggle of ass, local dry
cleaning discounts, lucrative film deals,

318
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:38,092
both origin stories and larger,
ensemble team movies.

319
00:36:38,592 --> 00:36:41,693
Con: they're all lame-ass teacher's pets!

320
00:36:41,894 --> 00:36:45,996
- You know I can hear you.
- Wasn't talking to you. I was talking to them.

321
00:36:46,096 --> 00:36:51,098
Stay right here. You've been
warned before, Deadpool.

322
00:36:51,198 --> 00:36:56,602
This is a shameful and reckless use of your
powers. You will both be coming with us.

323
00:36:56,702 --> 00:37:03,105
Look Colossus, I don't have time for the goody
two-shoes bullshit right now. And you are?

324
00:37:04,106 --> 00:37:06,107
Negasonic Teenage Warhead.

325
00:37:06,208 --> 00:37:09,710
Negasonic Teenage---
What the shit?!

326
00:37:09,911 --> 00:37:12,112
That's the coolest name ever!

327
00:37:13,112 --> 00:37:17,114
- So what, you're like his sidekick?
- No. Trainee.

328
00:37:17,214 --> 00:37:22,617
- Let me guess, X-Men left you behind
on what, shit detail?
- What does that make you?

329
00:37:22,918 --> 00:37:26,119
Pretending you're not here, Negasonic
Teenage Warhead. Can we trade names?

330
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,922
- Can we go?
- "Look! I'm a teenage girl!"

331
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:38,127
"I'd rather be anywhere than here. I'm all about long, sullen
silences, followed by mean comments, followed by more silences."

332
00:37:39,128 --> 00:37:44,130
So what's it gonna be? Long, sullen
silence? Or mean comment? Go on.

333
00:37:46,132 --> 00:37:52,135
- You got me in a box here.
- We can't allow this, Deadpool. Please, come quietly.

334
00:37:52,235 --> 00:37:55,137
- You big, chrome cockgobbler!
- That's not nice.

335
00:37:55,237 --> 00:37:58,139
You really got to fuck
this up for me? Trust me...

336
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:04,142
That wheezing bag of dick-tits
has it coming! He's pure evil!

337
00:38:04,242 --> 00:38:08,145
Besides, nobody's getting hurt.

338
00:38:13,148 --> 00:38:16,149
That guy was already
up there when I got here.

339
00:38:16,249 --> 00:38:20,677
Wade, you are better than this.
Join us, use your powers for good.

340
00:38:20,702 --> 00:38:22,177
Heads up!

341
00:38:22,254 --> 00:38:26,956
- Be a superhero.
- Listen! The day I decide to be a crime-fighting shit-swizzler,

342
00:38:27,156 --> 00:38:35,760
who rooms with a bunch of other little whiners, at the Neverland
Mansion of some creepy, old, bald, heaven's gate looking motherfucker,

343
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:42,164
on that day, I'll send your shiny, happy ass a friend
request. But until then, I'mma do what I came here to do.

344
00:38:42,264 --> 00:38:44,166
- Either that, or slap the bitch out of you!
- Wade...

345
00:38:45,166 --> 00:38:48,768
- Hey. Hey, Douchepool!
- Zip it, Sinead!

346
00:38:48,968 --> 00:38:51,170
And I hope you're watching...

347
00:38:54,171 --> 00:38:56,172
Quite unfortunate.

348
00:38:59,175 --> 00:39:02,176
That does it!

349
00:39:05,178 --> 00:39:07,180
Canada!

350
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,182
- That's not good. Cock shot!
- Wade, please.

351
00:39:13,183 --> 00:39:16,184
Oh, your poor wife!

352
00:39:16,284 --> 00:39:18,186
You really should stop.

353
00:39:20,487 --> 00:39:23,589
All the dinosaurs fear the T-Rex.

354
00:39:27,191 --> 00:39:31,193
- I promise this gets worse for you, big boy!
- This is embarassing.

355
00:39:32,194 --> 00:39:34,196
Please. Stay down.

356
00:39:35,196 --> 00:39:37,898
Did you ever hear of the one-legged
man in the ass-kicking contest?

357
00:39:37,998 --> 00:39:41,900
- Do you have 'off' switch?
- Yeah, it's right next to the prostate. Or is that the 'on' switch?

358
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,501
Enough!

359
00:39:52,206 --> 00:39:54,207
Let us go talk to the Professor.

360
00:39:55,208 --> 00:39:59,811
McAvoy or Stewart? These
timelines are so confusing...

361
00:40:00,211 --> 00:40:05,614
- Dead or alive, you're coming with me!
- You will recover, Wade. You always do.

362
00:40:11,052 --> 00:40:14,063
Did you ever see "127 Hours"?
Spoiler alert!

363
00:40:18,078 --> 00:40:21,089
Oh my God. Nasty.

364
00:40:23,096 --> 00:40:29,119
Oh, there's the money shot, baby. Are
you there, God? It's me, Margaret.

365
00:40:39,156 --> 00:40:41,164
Rock, meet bottom.

366
00:40:42,168 --> 00:40:49,194
When life ends up breathtakingly fucked, you can
generally trace it back to one big, bad decision.

367
00:40:49,294 --> 00:40:52,205
The one that sent you
down the road to Shitsburg.

368
00:40:52,305 --> 00:40:55,216
This, well, this was mine.

369
00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:02,243
Mr. Wilson. Nothing warms my heart
more than a change of someone else's.

370
00:41:03,247 --> 00:41:06,258
You've finally hit fuck-it.

371
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:12,281
- Just promise you'll do right by me.
So I can do right by someone else.
- Of course.

372
00:41:13,285 --> 00:41:18,303
And please don't make the
super-suit green. Or animated!

373
00:41:38,379 --> 00:41:43,398
This place seems sanitary.
My first request is warmer hands.

374
00:41:43,498 --> 00:41:47,413
And Jesus! A warmer table.

375
00:41:48,416 --> 00:41:53,435
You should really come up with a safe
word, fellas. I'm thinking 'pork and beans'.

376
00:41:55,919 --> 00:41:57,927
Easy!

377
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:00,779
Aren't you a little strong for a lady?

378
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,772
I'm calling Wang.

379
00:42:06,779 --> 00:42:11,798
What's up with the matches?
Oral fixation? Or just a big Stallone fan?

380
00:42:12,801 --> 00:42:18,821
- Patience, Angel. All in good time.
- Are you here for the turn down service or what?

381
00:42:20,093 --> 00:42:23,586
- We have another talker.
- I'm just excited about my first day at superhero camp.

382
00:42:23,787 --> 00:42:25,809
Shut the fuck up.

383
00:42:28,861 --> 00:42:33,880
Mr. Wilson, my name's
Ajax. I manage this workshop.

384
00:42:34,984 --> 00:42:37,895
All of my welcome speeches used
to be filled with euphemisms like,

385
00:42:37,895 --> 00:42:41,910
"this may hurt a little," or
"this might cause you some discomfort."

386
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:46,327
But I'm going blunt. This workshop
is not a government-led program.

387
00:42:46,929 --> 00:42:51,245
It's a private institution that turns reclamation
projects like yourself into men of....

388
00:42:51,947 --> 00:42:54,958
Extraordinary abilities.

389
00:42:55,962 --> 00:43:00,981
But if you think superhuman powers
are acquired painlessly... Wrong.

390
00:43:01,483 --> 00:43:05,699
I'm injecting you with a serum that activates
any mutant genes lurking in your DNA.

391
00:43:05,899 --> 00:43:11,019
For it to work, we need to
subject you to extreme stress.

392
00:43:15,034 --> 00:43:19,049
You've heard the whole, "make an
omelet, break some eggs" bit, I hope.

393
00:43:19,451 --> 00:43:24,068
I'm about to hurt you, Wade. I was
a patient here once myself, you know.

394
00:43:25,072 --> 00:43:30,090
The treatment affects everyone differently.
It made Angel inhumanly strong.

395
00:43:31,094 --> 00:43:38,422
In my case, it enhanced my reflexes, also scorched
my nerve endings so I no longer feel pain.

396
00:43:40,129 --> 00:43:43,742
And in fact, I no
longer feel anything.

397
00:43:53,177 --> 00:43:57,192
Thank-- thank you! You
have something in your teeth.

398
00:43:58,196 --> 00:44:03,215
Right in the middle there, just...
Nugget of romaine lettuce or something.

399
00:44:05,222 --> 00:44:07,229
It's been bothering
me for a long time.

400
00:44:09,236 --> 00:44:14,758
Made you look. Hey, is Ajax your actual name,
because it sounds suspiciously made up.

401
00:44:14,858 --> 00:44:22,486
What is it really? Kevin? Bruce? Scott?
Mitch? Rickster? Is it Basil Faulty?

402
00:44:22,595 --> 00:44:27,204
Joke away. One thing that never survives
this place is your sense of humor.

403
00:44:27,304 --> 00:44:30,316
- We'll see about that.
- I suppose we will.

404
00:44:31,319 --> 00:44:38,345
- He's all yours.
- C'mon. You're gonna leave me all alone
here with less angry Rosie O'Donnell?

405
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:50,390
This is how it's going to work. Adrenaline acts as a catalyst
for the serum, so we're gonna have to make you suffer.

406
00:44:51,395 --> 00:44:56,414
If you're lucky, your mutant genes will
activate and manifest in a spectacular fashion.

407
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:04,444
If not, well, we'll have
to keep on hurting you.

408
00:45:05,447 --> 00:45:09,462
In new and different ways,
each more painful than the last.

409
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:14,481
Until you finally mutate...

410
00:45:15,485 --> 00:45:17,443
... or die.

411
00:45:23,515 --> 00:45:30,542
- You mean like a bucket list?
- Like a fuck it list, I'd like to light a
spiff off the Olympic torch.

412
00:45:30,642 --> 00:45:33,151
Acid to me, right after.

413
00:45:33,251 --> 00:45:39,575
Let's not forget: naked tandem base-jumping
with the WNBA's Sacramento Monarchs.

414
00:45:39,676 --> 00:45:42,587
Anything on my bucket list
would involve public nudity.

415
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:46,602
Finally, giving Meredith
Baxter Birney a dutch oven.

416
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:50,215
No, receiving a dutch oven
from Meredith Baxter Birney.

417
00:45:53,628 --> 00:45:57,643
Making banana
pancakes... For my kids...

418
00:46:01,055 --> 00:46:03,665
Vanessa...

419
00:46:06,676 --> 00:46:09,688
I wanna see Vanessa.

420
00:46:09,788 --> 00:46:13,702
Oh, lovely. I don't know about
anyone else but, I'm touched.

421
00:46:13,803 --> 00:46:20,729
- We're just joking.
- No, no. It's okay. I encourage distractions.

422
00:46:20,829 --> 00:46:23,740
Wouldn't want you giving
up on us now, would we?

423
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:27,755
Hey, don't take any shit from him,
Cunningham. How tough can he be...

424
00:46:28,759 --> 00:46:32,773
- ... with a name like Francis?
- Francis?

425
00:46:33,777 --> 00:46:38,796
It's his legal name. He
got Ajax from a dish soap.

426
00:46:40,804 --> 00:46:45,823
F-R-A-N-C-I--- oops!

427
00:46:48,533 --> 00:46:51,845
Snagged the dry cleaning
tag off your lab coat.

428
00:46:51,946 --> 00:46:55,860
FYI, I can probably get
you a superhero discount.

429
00:46:55,961 --> 00:46:59,875
- You are so relentlessly annoying.
- Thanks. Never heard that before.

430
00:46:59,976 --> 00:47:04,894
Why don't you do us all a favor and shut
the fuck up? Or I'll sew your pretty mouth shut.

431
00:47:05,795 --> 00:47:09,587
Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you.

432
00:47:09,686 --> 00:47:15,673
See, here's the problem with round-the-clock
torture, it's that you can't really step it up from there.

433
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:20,663
Is that what you think?

434
00:47:25,653 --> 00:47:30,343
If this doesn't unlock your
mutation, then, well, nothing will.

435
00:47:30,643 --> 00:47:36,629
What we're gonna do is lower the oxygen concentration in
the air to the exact point you feel like you're suffocating.

436
00:47:36,729 --> 00:47:42,616
If your brain wave's slowing and you're about
to pass out, then we'll turn up the O2.

437
00:47:42,717 --> 00:47:47,606
If your heart rate slows meaning you're able
to catch your breath, we'll turn it back down.

438
00:47:48,604 --> 00:47:52,595
And that's where we'll
leave you. Right there.

439
00:47:53,592 --> 00:47:57,584
- I thought you guys were dicks before...
- You know the funniest part of this?

440
00:47:58,582 --> 00:48:01,575
You still think we're
making you a superhero.

441
00:48:01,676 --> 00:48:08,361
You? A dishonorable discharge?
Hip deep in hookers?

442
00:48:08,561 --> 00:48:13,550
You're nothing. A little secret, Wade...

443
00:48:13,650 --> 00:48:17,542
This workshop doesn't make
superheroes, we make superslaves.

444
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:23,529
We're gonna fit you with a control collar
and auction you off to the highest bidder.

445
00:48:23,629 --> 00:48:28,518
And that's what they'll have you doing. Terrorizing
citizens, putting down freedom fighters.

446
00:48:30,514 --> 00:48:33,508
Maybe just mow
the occasional lawn.

447
00:48:34,506 --> 00:48:36,501
What the fuck is wrong with you?

448
00:48:41,491 --> 00:48:47,179
You're never going home after
this. Now there's a brave face.

449
00:48:47,478 --> 00:48:50,472
Wait, wait, wait...

450
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:56,459
Seriously, you actually have
something in your teeth now.

451
00:48:57,457 --> 00:49:03,444
- Enjoy your weekend.
- Weekend? Back up, weekend?

452
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:49,346
Did I say this was a love
story? No. It's a horror movie.

453
00:50:05,313 --> 00:50:10,302
Fucking hell! Looks like someone
lost a shot at homecoming king.

454
00:50:10,402 --> 00:50:16,289
- What have you done to me?
- I've mainly raised your stress levels
high enough to trigger a mutation.

455
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:21,279
- You sadistic fuck!
- I've cured you, Wade.

456
00:50:21,378 --> 00:50:27,266
Now your mutated cells can heal anything.
Striking your cancer as fast as it can form.

457
00:50:28,264 --> 00:50:33,253
Yeah, I've seen some other side
effects before... I could cure them.

458
00:50:36,247 --> 00:50:38,242
But where's the fun in that?

459
00:50:40,239 --> 00:50:43,232
Now I'm gonna shut
you in again, Wade.

460
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:48,222
Not because I need to.

461
00:50:51,215 --> 00:50:53,211
Because I want to.

462
00:51:07,182 --> 00:51:10,175
Farewell. Go ahead.

463
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:15,164
You already smell like shit.

464
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:22,150
- Motherfucker...
- That's alright, it's alright...

465
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:29,135
I think we have earned that one.
You take off. Go on, off you go.

466
00:51:40,111 --> 00:51:42,106
Quick question:

467
00:51:44,102 --> 00:51:46,097
What's my name?

468
00:51:51,087 --> 00:51:54,081
Didn't think so.

469
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:58,072
Sorry, Francis. My lips are sealed.

470
00:53:54,039 --> 00:53:58,652
You don't wanna kill me. I'm the
only one who can fix your ugly mug!

471
00:54:54,543 --> 00:54:56,538
What's my name?

472
00:55:02,524 --> 00:55:04,518
Wade...

473
00:56:10,354 --> 00:56:18,334
I didn't just get the cure to el cancer...
I got the cure to el everything.

474
00:56:21,326 --> 00:56:26,314
But there was only one
thing that really mattered.

475
00:57:47,112 --> 00:57:50,803
No way. I'm not making
her life as ugly as mine.

476
00:57:51,002 --> 00:57:56,090
- Come on, Wade, it can't be that bad.
- Bullshit! I'm a monster inside now.

477
00:57:56,189 --> 00:57:59,781
- I belong in a fucking circus.
- Wade, Vanessa loves you.

478
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:03,072
- She doesn't care what you--- Oh!
- Do you like what you see?

479
00:58:03,172 --> 00:58:09,855
No. You look like an avocado had sex
with an older, more disgusting avocado.

480
00:58:10,054 --> 00:58:18,035
Not gently. He was hate-fucking. There was something wrong with the relationship and that was their only catharsis without violence.

481
00:58:18,135 --> 00:58:25,617
And the only guy who can fix this fugly mug is the British
shitstick who ran the mutant factory. And he's gone--- Poof!

482
00:58:25,816 --> 00:58:29,506
You gotta do something to remedy this. 'Cause
as of now, you only have one course of action:

483
00:58:30,005 --> 00:58:33,596
- Damn straight. Find Francis.
- Star in horror fims.

484
00:58:33,796 --> 00:58:36,788
- What?
- Star in your own horror films.

485
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:40,479
'Cause you look like Freddy Krueger face-
fucked a topographical map of Utah.

486
00:58:41,377 --> 00:58:42,773
Here's what I'm actually gonna do:

487
00:58:42,874 --> 00:58:49,956
I'm gonna work thru his crew until somebody gives up Francis,
force him to fix this, put a bullet in his skull, and fuck the brainhole.

488
00:58:50,055 --> 00:58:52,948
I don't wanna see that,
or think of it again. But,

489
00:58:53,048 --> 00:58:55,940
- the douchebag does think you're dead, right?
- Yeah.

490
00:58:56,041 --> 00:58:59,930
- That's good. You should keep it that way.
- What, like, wear a mask?

491
00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:06,913
Yes, a very thick mask. All the
time. I'm sorry, you're haunting.

492
00:59:07,013 --> 00:59:10,603
- Your face is the stuff of nightmares.
- Like a testicle with teeth.

493
00:59:10,703 --> 00:59:16,888
You will die alone. I mean if you
could die. Ideally. For others' sake.

494
00:59:16,987 --> 00:59:21,876
- That'll do.
- What you need now is a suit and a
nickname, like Wade the Wisecracker...

495
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:28,858
- ... or Scaredevil, Mr. Neverdie. Oh, shit.
- What?

496
00:59:29,855 --> 00:59:34,843
- I put all my money on you, and now I
just realized I'm never gonna win the....
- Deadpool...

497
00:59:37,835 --> 00:59:40,829
Captain Deadpool.

498
00:59:41,825 --> 00:59:44,819
No. Just-just Deadpool. Yeah.

499
00:59:44,918 --> 00:59:50,803
To you, Mr. Pool. Deadpool. That
sounds like a fuckin' franchise.

500
01:00:04,768 --> 01:00:06,764
This shit's gonna
have nuts in it!

501
01:00:23,231 --> 01:00:25,303
Where's Francis?

502
01:00:33,185 --> 01:00:40,637
Seltzer water and lemon for
blood. Or wear red. Dumbass!

503
01:00:59,801 --> 01:01:01,932
Don't make me ask twice.

504
01:01:28,308 --> 01:01:31,819
You're about to be
killed by a Zamboni!

505
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:38,903
- No, please...
- Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

506
01:01:39,939 --> 01:01:43,045
Little spider-monkey!

507
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:57,535
This is confusing! Is it sexist to hit you, is it
more sexist to not hit you, the line gets real blurry!

508
01:01:57,638 --> 01:01:59,604
Donde esta Francesca?

509
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:06,851
Tell me where your fucking boss is!
Or you're gonna die! In 5 minutes!

510
01:02:33,709 --> 01:02:40,685
Nice to see you, Jared. I'll
take a foot long. Fully loaded.

511
01:02:55,634 --> 01:03:02,112
- 41 confirmed kills. Now it's 89, about to be 90.
- Mr. Wilson?

512
01:03:03,607 --> 01:03:08,589
- You're looking very alive.
- Hah! Only on the outside.

513
01:03:08,689 --> 01:03:11,579
- This is not going to end---
- This is not gonna end well for you, no.

514
01:03:11,679 --> 01:03:14,569
- Where's your boss?
- I can tell you exactly where---

515
01:03:15,565 --> 01:03:22,542
You'll tell me. But first, you might wanna look
away for this. Now this little piggy went to...

516
01:03:23,659 --> 01:03:25,707
Thank you, Agent Smith.

517
01:03:29,803 --> 01:03:31,944
Taxi!

518
01:03:31,944 --> 01:03:32,143
Hop in! Great day for a ride.
Taxi!

519
01:03:32,143 --> 01:03:35,476
Hop in! Great day for a ride.

520
01:03:36,653 --> 01:03:39,007
And we all know
how this turned out.

521
01:03:40,747 --> 01:03:43,120
Whoops! You weren't
meant to see that.

522
01:03:51,427 --> 01:03:54,987
There. All caught up.

523
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:08,333
Sorry! About bleeding
at all your garbage.

524
01:04:14,367 --> 01:04:16,440
Seltzer water and
lemon for blood.

525
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:17,990
Some kinds of anger
can't be managed.
Seltzer water and
lemon for blood.

526
01:04:17,990 --> 01:04:19,647
Some kinds of anger
can't be managed.

527
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:26,306
Like the kind where your year-long plan
ends with the wrong guy getting dismembered!

528
01:04:26,429 --> 01:04:32,472
That said, when it comes time to licking
wounds, there's no place like home.

529
01:05:09,653 --> 01:05:11,612
Morning, sleepyhead.

530
01:05:12,591 --> 01:05:17,193
- It smells like old lady pants in here.
- Yes I'm old, I wear pants.

531
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:20,421
But you're no lady.
Oh, so comfy.

532
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:26,981
- Upside of being blind, I've never seen you in crocs.
- You mean my big, rubber, masturbating shoes?

533
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:33,148
Yes I know. Downside of being blind,
I hear everything in this duplex.

534
01:05:35,009 --> 01:05:38,045
- Sit on a stick.
- Bactine?

535
01:05:39,023 --> 01:05:40,981
Bactine should do it.

536
01:05:41,959 --> 01:05:46,854
How's that () coming along? Ikea
doesn't assemble itself, you know.

537
01:05:46,952 --> 01:05:51,749
You're telling me. I don't mind the ().
It's an improvement on the ().

538
01:05:51,749 --> 01:05:54,294
Anything's an improvement over the ().

539
01:05:54,686 --> 01:05:57,623
I'd taken an () or a () over the ().

540
01:05:59,582 --> 01:06:01,343
No, I didn't get
excited 'till I saw ().

541
01:06:01,539 --> 01:06:05,259
- Screw, please.
- Here? Now? Just kidding. I know it's been decades.

542
01:06:05,358 --> 01:06:08,392
- You'd be surprised.
- Pretty grossed out.

543
01:06:09,371 --> 01:06:12,307
Ta------da...

544
01:06:17,966 --> 01:06:21,119
I wish I never heard, of Craigslist.

545
01:06:21,217 --> 01:06:27,678
And I quote, "Looking for roommate, blind, and likes imperfections. Must be good with hands." Or would you rather I build the Ikea and you pay rent?

546
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:30,908
- Why such a douche this morning?
- Let's recap:

547
01:06:31,007 --> 01:06:35,804
The cock-fizzle that turned me into this
freak slipped through my arms today.

548
01:06:36,782 --> 01:06:38,152
Arm.

549
01:06:38,350 --> 01:06:43,635
Catching him was my only chance to be hot again, get my super
-sexy ex back and prevent this from happening to someone else.

550
01:06:43,733 --> 01:06:46,571
So yeah, today was about as
much fun as a sandpaper dildo.

551
01:06:49,216 --> 01:06:50,977
#drive-by.

552
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:11,046
Found out who our
friend in the red suit is.

553
01:07:12,024 --> 01:07:17,898
Fucking Wade Wilson. Suppose I'd wear
a mask, too, if I had a face like that.

554
01:07:17,996 --> 01:07:19,856
I only wish I'd heal the same.

555
01:07:23,381 --> 01:07:26,709
Still, we'll put him out of
our misery. On our terms.

556
01:07:28,408 --> 01:07:34,416
- Right. And when he heals?
- He can't. Not if there's nothing left of him to heal.

557
01:07:34,516 --> 01:07:39,421
You know, it's funny. I
almost missed the fucker.

558
01:07:40,423 --> 01:07:46,730
I like a challenge. But he's bad
for business. Now let's go find him.

559
01:07:51,436 --> 01:07:55,440
- Tylenol PM?
- It sticks back where you stuck the Bactine.

560
01:07:55,540 --> 01:08:02,449
I raided my stash of wisdom just to take a sec
and I am orbiting fucking Saturn right now.

561
01:08:05,052 --> 01:08:07,455
But I appreciate the gesture.

562
01:08:08,456 --> 01:08:12,461
Am I crazy? Or is
your hand really small?

563
01:08:12,561 --> 01:08:15,465
About the size of a KFC spork.

564
01:08:16,466 --> 01:08:22,974
I get why you're so pissy, but your mood's never gonna
brighten 'till you find this woman and tell her how you feel.

565
01:08:23,074 --> 01:08:28,480
What do I keep telling you, Mrs. McGoo? She wouldn't
have me. If you could see me, you'd understand.

566
01:08:28,581 --> 01:08:32,985
- Looks aren't everything.
- Looks are everything! Ever heard David Beckham speak?

567
01:08:33,085 --> 01:08:38,993
It's like he mouth-sexed a can of helium. You think
Ryan Reynolds got this far on a superior acting method?

568
01:08:39,093 --> 01:08:40,995
- Love is blind, Wade.
- No...

569
01:08:41,496 --> 01:08:43,498
You're blind.

570
01:08:43,599 --> 01:08:46,502
So you're just gonna
lie there and whimper?

571
01:08:46,602 --> 01:08:52,107
No, I'm gonna wait 'till this arm plows through puberty
and then I'll come up with a whole, new Christmas day plan.

572
01:08:52,308 --> 01:08:57,514
In the meantime, you might wanna leave
the room. I bet it feels huge in this hand.

573
01:08:58,516 --> 01:09:01,519
Go, go, go, go, go...

574
01:09:02,519 --> 01:09:07,326
So the doctor says, the bad news is you don't have
that long to live. So the patient says, how long do I have?

575
01:09:07,426 --> 01:09:10,529
The doctor says, five.
The guys says, five what?

576
01:09:10,630 --> 01:09:14,534
The doctor says, 4, 3, 2...

577
01:09:20,542 --> 01:09:23,144
Can I help you ladies?

578
01:09:25,547 --> 01:09:27,550
Oh, I do hope so.

579
01:09:30,553 --> 01:09:35,560
Now, I heard you might be able to point
me in the direction of a, a friend of mine.

580
01:09:35,660 --> 01:09:37,562
Name of Wade Wilson.

581
01:09:38,563 --> 01:09:41,566
Sorry, I don't know the name.

582
01:09:48,575 --> 01:09:51,448
Hey, you're not supposed
to be behind the bar.

583
01:09:54,582 --> 01:09:59,589
- I've seen this girl.
- This must be Vanessa. I've
heard so much about you.

584
01:10:03,593 --> 01:10:08,599
Sweetheart, you might wanna look around. This
isn't really the place to do something like that.

585
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:13,605
Easy, Angel. Put
the little man down.

586
01:10:14,607 --> 01:10:17,610
- We have everything we need now.
- You sure?

587
01:10:18,612 --> 01:10:21,615
You don't want any clothes
that are not monochromatic?

588
01:10:22,534 --> 01:10:25,352
There's a midnight showing of Blade II.

589
01:10:28,268 --> 01:10:31,183
Thanks for having my back, guys.

590
01:10:35,654 --> 01:10:39,444
Wade, we have a fucking
problem, and by we, I mean you.

591
01:10:40,609 --> 01:10:45,760
I can't believe we're doing this. Is there
a word for half-afraid, half-angry?

592
01:10:45,858 --> 01:10:48,676
"Afrangry", I guess. Have you
decided what you're gonna say to her?

593
01:10:48,754 --> 01:10:53,244
- Fuck me!
- Maybe not start with that.

594
01:10:58,394 --> 01:11:04,225
Hey, coming on to our stage
right now, give it up for Chastity!

595
01:11:07,141 --> 01:11:12,000
- Or as I like to call her, Irony.
- I gotta find her fast, before numb nuts does.

596
01:11:12,098 --> 01:11:16,860
- How do you know she's in here?
- Some customer stalking that fox.

597
01:11:41,749 --> 01:11:45,760
Every time I see her,
it's like the first time.

598
01:11:46,262 --> 01:11:48,768
Especially from this angle.

599
01:12:11,829 --> 01:12:15,839
You can't buy love, but you
can rent it for three minutes.

600
01:12:18,847 --> 01:12:21,855
You weak motherfucker!

601
01:12:22,857 --> 01:12:27,871
C'mon. Get it together, this isn't
about you, this is about Vanessa.

602
01:12:31,881 --> 01:12:33,885
Here we go.

603
01:12:35,891 --> 01:12:37,896
Maximum effort.

604
01:12:40,904 --> 01:12:42,508
Vanessa!

605
01:12:44,914 --> 01:12:50,931
Someone out back asking for you.
Something about... an old boyfriend?

606
01:13:16,999 --> 01:13:22,012
I knew it was you. 'Cause
we're weird curvy edges.

607
01:13:23,015 --> 01:13:25,020
Like a jigsaw puzzle.

608
01:13:35,046 --> 01:13:38,054
You have Wade Wilson to thank for this.

609
01:13:46,075 --> 01:13:51,089
- Hey, where did she go?
- I saw her head to the back. Go get her, tiger.

610
01:14:18,561 --> 01:14:20,165
Motherfucker!

611
01:14:20,165 --> 01:14:22,972
- Wade, Wade, Wade, Wade...
- Cunt! Chocolate---

612
01:14:23,172 --> 01:14:28,185
- Jiminy---- Fuck! Fuck!
- We can talk... or you can hit that...

613
01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:36,206
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Relax, relax. Okay...

614
01:14:36,206 --> 01:14:43,225
I'm gonna rip his motherfucking-- find
that, find it, or I'm gonna get angry.

615
01:14:45,231 --> 01:14:49,140
Here, this is Vanessa.
No, wait, it's Francis.

616
01:14:49,241 --> 01:14:52,249
- He wants you to come to him.
- What is that?

617
01:14:52,349 --> 01:14:58,264
That's the shit emoji. It's the turd with the smiling face and
the eyes. I thought it was chocolate yogurt for so long.

618
01:14:58,566 --> 01:15:01,272
- I need guns.
- Okay, which ones?

619
01:15:01,373 --> 01:15:04,281
- I need all the guns!
- All right, okay.

620
01:15:23,731 --> 01:15:28,745
- That's about 3000 rounds.
- And we all know what I can do with 12.

621
01:15:29,046 --> 01:15:32,354
Hey, hey, careful with that,
Ronnie Milsap, we're downrange.

622
01:15:33,357 --> 01:15:38,370
I was gonna spend the night assembling
the () but this is holding my interest.

623
01:15:38,471 --> 01:15:44,386
- I told you, we're going with the (), not the (),
get it thru your head or get outta Fucktown!
- Shit.

624
01:15:44,486 --> 01:15:48,396
- That's all the pieces in the house.
- No, no, no, come on. Let's go. Cough it up.

625
01:15:51,404 --> 01:15:54,413
- Down, down, down, down.
- Fuck you.

626
01:15:55,415 --> 01:15:58,423
25 cal. I like it.

627
01:16:00,328 --> 01:16:01,431
Wade...

628
01:16:02,433 --> 01:16:06,444
I'd go with you, but...
I don't wanna.

629
01:16:08,449 --> 01:16:11,457
Oh, listen, Al...

630
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:17,473
If I never see you again, I want you
to know that I love you very much.

631
01:16:18,475 --> 01:16:25,493
And also, there's about 116 kilos of cocaine buried somewhere
in the apartment, right next to the cure for blindness.

632
01:16:25,594 --> 01:16:27,499
Good luck.

633
01:16:31,509 --> 01:16:34,517
You wanna get fucked up?

634
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:45,546
Put her down over here.

635
01:16:54,570 --> 01:16:56,575
Go on, then.

636
01:16:58,581 --> 01:17:04,596
- Thanks, dickless. And I mean you.
- You're a talker, too. You and Wade.

637
01:17:04,696 --> 01:17:09,610
I've been trying to tell you assholes you
got the wrong girl. My old boyfriend, he's dead.

638
01:17:09,710 --> 01:17:17,631
See, I thought that, too. But he keeps on
coming back. Like a cockroach, but uglier.

639
01:17:17,731 --> 01:17:25,151
Now, I may not feel, but he does. Let's see
how he fights with your head on the block.

640
01:17:32,670 --> 01:17:36,681
- Ripley! From Alien 3!
- Fuck, you're old.

641
01:17:37,684 --> 01:17:44,802
- Fake laugh! Hiding real pain! Go get Silver balls.
- You guys going for a bite? Early bird special?

642
01:17:45,002 --> 01:17:48,211
Like there's something wrong with eating
before sundown or saving money. No.

643
01:17:48,411 --> 01:17:52,723
You know that bad guy that
you let go? He's got my girl.

644
01:17:53,725 --> 01:17:57,485
- You're gonna help me get her back.
- Wade? Is that you?

645
01:17:57,586 --> 01:18:01,746
Yeah, it's me Deadpool, and I got
an offer that you can't refuse!

646
01:18:04,354 --> 01:18:06,358
I'm gonna wait out here,
okay? It's a big house!

647
01:18:06,458 --> 01:18:11,772
It's funny that I only ever see 2 of you. It s almost
like, the studio couldn't afford another X-Man.

648
01:18:11,902 --> 01:18:17,216
And that, is why in my opinion, the
movie Cocoon, is pure pornography.

649
01:18:18,219 --> 01:18:22,230
- Who brought this twinkly man?
- Twinkly, but deadly.

650
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:30,952
My chrome-penised friend back there, has agreed to do me this
solid. In exchange, I said I would consider joining his boy band.

651
01:18:31,053 --> 01:18:34,261
- It's not boy band.
- Sure, it's not.

652
01:18:34,261 --> 01:18:43,285
- So, any luck winning Gita back?
- I tried to hold on tight, Mr. Pool, but Bandu
is more craftier and handsomer than me.

653
01:18:43,386 --> 01:18:46,293
Well, I think you're pretty darn cute.

654
01:18:51,306 --> 01:18:53,312
- Dopinder?
- Hmm?

655
01:18:54,916 --> 01:19:04,039
- What was that?
- That was........ Bandu, in the trunk?

656
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:07,348
- Ban-who?
- My romantic rival, Bandu.

657
01:19:07,448 --> 01:19:14,367
He's tied up in the trunk. I'm doing as you said, DP, I plan to gut
him like a tandoori fish then dump his carcass on Gita's doorstep.

658
01:19:14,468 --> 01:19:19,380
I did not tell him to do that! Absolutely
not! We got lost in translation!

659
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:23,692
Dopinder, this is no way to win Gita's
heart back! (I'm so proud of you.)

660
01:19:23,792 --> 01:19:27,100
Drop Bandu off safe
and gentle-like. (Kill him.)

661
01:19:27,201 --> 01:19:33,417
And then, win Gita back the old-fashioned
way, with your boyish charm! (Kidnap her.)

662
01:19:34,420 --> 01:19:36,425
He's super dead.

663
01:19:41,438 --> 01:19:45,448
- I presume a crisp high-five?
- For you? Ten!

664
01:19:45,950 --> 01:19:50,462
Okay, guys, let's get out there and make
a difference! (You know what to do.)

665
01:19:51,865 --> 01:19:53,470
Knock 'em dead, pool boy!

666
01:19:55,476 --> 01:19:58,081
Time to make the
chimi-fucking-changas.

667
01:19:59,184 --> 01:20:08,007
Not often a dude ruins your face, skullstomps your sanity,
grabs your baby mama and personally sees thru 4 of your 5 shittiest moments.

668
01:20:08,074 --> 01:20:12,479
Let's just say it's beginning
to look a lot like Christmas.

669
01:20:25,093 --> 01:20:28,497
Hey, where's your duffel bag?

670
01:20:51,521 --> 01:20:56,527
Goddammit! We'll do this the old-
fashioned way. With two swords..

671
01:20:57,627 --> 01:20:59,029
... and maximum effort.

672
01:20:59,129 --> 01:21:01,532
Cue the music.

673
01:21:16,548 --> 01:21:18,550
Wade Wilson!

674
01:21:19,552 --> 01:21:23,555
- What's my name?
- Ooh, I'mma fucking spell it out for 'ya.

675
01:21:25,558 --> 01:21:30,563
- Go get some.
- Superhero landing. She's gonna
do a superhero landing, wait for it!

676
01:21:34,568 --> 01:21:39,572
Superhero landing! You know, that's really hard
on your knees. Totally impractical, they all do it.

677
01:21:39,672 --> 01:21:44,277
You're a lovely lady but I'm saving myself
for Francis. That's why I brought him.

678
01:21:44,428 --> 01:21:48,581
I'd prefer not to hit a
woman, so please----

679
01:21:54,587 --> 01:21:57,591
I mean, that's why I brought her?

680
01:21:59,293 --> 01:22:04,599
Oh no. Finish your tweet. Just give us
a second. Here you go. Hash tag it.

681
01:22:05,599 --> 01:22:07,602
Go get her, tiger.

682
01:22:14,609 --> 01:22:18,613
I so pity the dude who
pressures her into prom sex.

683
01:22:18,713 --> 01:22:20,916
Alright then. Fire!

684
01:22:32,128 --> 01:22:33,819
Finish fucking her the fuck off!

685
01:22:34,030 --> 01:22:36,132
- Language, please.
- Suck a cock!

686
01:23:02,210 --> 01:23:05,964
Look away, child. Look away!

687
01:23:12,671 --> 01:23:17,677
- Wait! Wait!
- Cease fire! Cease fire!

688
01:23:17,777 --> 01:23:24,684
Fellas, hey, you only work for
that shit-spackled Muppet fart.

689
01:23:24,784 --> 01:23:33,493
So, I'mma give you a chance for y'all to lay down your firearms
in exchange for preferential, bordering on gentle, possibly...

690
01:23:33,693 --> 01:23:36,097
... even lover-like treatment.

691
01:23:37,698 --> 01:23:40,300
Fine! Commando!

692
01:24:52,377 --> 01:24:53,778
Teabag!

693
01:24:56,782 --> 01:25:00,185
- Bob?
- Wade?

694
01:25:00,385 --> 01:25:04,189
- Oh my God, I haven't seen you since, TGIFridays!
- Jacksonville. Fridays.

695
01:25:04,789 --> 01:25:09,394
What the hell! God!
Come here, you.

696
01:25:10,796 --> 01:25:17,804
How are the kids? Good? And Gail, is she still
fixing that tuna casserole? It's so good, but bad for...

697
01:25:24,811 --> 01:25:33,820
- Your... on the left... You are beautiful...
- That is so sweet! Thanks!

698
01:25:43,830 --> 01:25:47,835
Does he write you notes,
too? He's such a romantic.

699
01:25:47,935 --> 01:25:49,837
Don't worry, baby. I'm coming.

700
01:25:50,838 --> 01:25:52,140
Fire!

701
01:25:58,846 --> 01:26:02,851
Hey! Climb on.

702
01:26:51,903 --> 01:26:55,907
Motherfucker shoulda
worn his brown pants.

703
01:26:56,909 --> 01:27:02,515
- You were right, beautiful.
Red really is my color.
- Wade?

704
01:27:02,615 --> 01:27:06,569
Don't worry, baby. I'mma
get you outta that shitbox.

705
01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:10,923
- What better way to crawl back
inside that head of yours.
- Oh, you never left.

706
01:27:11,024 --> 01:27:14,928
- But you did, asshole!
- Deep breath, darling.

707
01:27:15,929 --> 01:27:20,935
No wait.... Wrong
choice of words.

708
01:27:21,935 --> 01:27:26,339
Well I hope they've blocked pain to your
every last nerve. 'Cause I'mma go looking!

709
01:27:27,741 --> 01:27:33,047
I hear you grow back body parts now, Wade.
When I'm finished, what's left to grow back you?

710
01:27:33,197 --> 01:27:36,951
Good one.... Yup.
That was a good one.

711
01:27:37,051 --> 01:27:42,456
Let's dance. And by "dance", I
mean let's try to kill each other.

712
01:28:36,614 --> 01:28:42,020
- Fine. Fists.
- Sounds like your last Saturday night.

713
01:30:02,104 --> 01:30:06,109
Asshole!

714
01:31:00,574 --> 01:31:05,610
- Hang in there, baby. I got you.
- Wade!

715
01:31:07,625 --> 01:31:10,346
I got a plan. You're
not gonna like it.

716
01:31:19,715 --> 01:31:22,737
Shit, shit, shit!

717
01:31:26,767 --> 01:31:30,797
Don't worry! I'm
totally on top of this.

718
01:31:45,910 --> 01:31:50,948
Dammit! Maximum effort!

719
01:32:33,262 --> 01:32:35,277
Thanks.

720
01:32:39,307 --> 01:24:38,736
Just take it slow.

721
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:55,125
Oh, my God! That was so awe---

722
01:33:28,069 --> 01:33:34,517
- Me and you, are headed
to fix this butter face!
- What?

723
01:33:35,726 --> 01:33:39,051
You sure are a fucking idiot.

724
01:33:39,253 --> 01:33:45,398
Did you really think
there was a cure, for that?

725
01:33:45,801 --> 01:33:49,831
- What?
- You heard me.

726
01:33:49,932 --> 01:33:52,853
No, no!

727
01:33:59,906 --> 01:34:07,264
So, you mean to say...
After all this, you can't fix me?

728
01:34:07,664 --> 01:34:09,184
It sounds even
stupider when you say it.

729
01:34:09,884 --> 01:34:14,524
Like the kind of stupid who admits he can't
do the one thing I'm keeping him alive for?

730
01:34:18,554 --> 01:34:20,564
Any last words?

731
01:34:21,574 --> 01:34:25,604
- What's my name?
- Who fucking cares!

732
01:34:25,704 --> 01:34:27,214
Wade!

733
01:34:27,624 --> 01:34:31,654
- Four or five moments.
- I'm sorry?

734
01:34:31,754 --> 01:34:36,684
- Four or five moments, that's all it takes.
- To...?

735
01:34:36,784 --> 01:34:38,704
Be a hero.

736
01:34:40,114 --> 01:34:49,584
Everyone thinks it's a full-time job. Wake up a hero.
Brush your teeth a hero. Go to work a hero. Not true.

737
01:34:49,784 --> 01:34:54,824
Over a lifetime, there are only 4
or 5 moments that really matter.

738
01:34:54,924 --> 01:34:57,644
Moments when you're offered a choice.

739
01:34:57,844 --> 01:35:01,874
To make a sacrifice, conquer
a flaw, save a friend...

740
01:35:02,374 --> 01:35:05,904
... spare an enemy.

741
01:35:06,004 --> 01:35:10,944
In these moments, everything else falls away.

742
01:35:11,044 --> 01:35:15,974
The way the world sees us.
The way we---

743
01:35:54,124 --> 01:35:59,064
- What the fuck am I gonna tell her?
- Well, you better figure it out.

744
01:36:00,574 --> 01:36:05,114
I can't even tell you... I deserve that...
that too.. No, no, no, maybe not the nethers.

745
01:36:05,414 --> 01:36:06,634
Start talking!

746
01:36:09,044 --> 01:36:16,294
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. For
everything. I'm sorry for leaving,

747
01:36:16,694 --> 01:36:23,754
- I'm sorry for not cowboying up sooner...
It's been a rough couple of years.
- Rough?

748
01:36:29,794 --> 01:36:34,834
I live in a crackhouse.
With a family of 12...

749
01:36:36,244 --> 01:36:40,874
Every night we spoon for warmth, everybody
fights for Noelle. She's the fattest.

750
01:36:40,974 --> 01:36:46,924
There is nothing that we don't share.
Floor space, dental floss, even condoms.

751
01:36:54,984 --> 01:36:57,684
So you live in a house?

752
01:37:06,064 --> 01:37:09,084
I should've come
and found you sooner.

753
01:37:10,094 --> 01:37:15,134
But everything under this mask,
he ain't the same one you remember.

754
01:37:19,164 --> 01:37:21,174
You made this mask?

755
01:37:40,324 --> 01:37:45,664
And this one. In case
the other fell off.

756
01:37:50,394 --> 01:37:56,444
Like a band-aid. Just... Audi 5000.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

757
01:37:56,544 --> 01:37:57,464
Are you sure?

758
01:37:59,974 --> 01:38:01,984
I'm sure.

759
01:38:12,064 --> 01:38:15,084
- Wow.
- Yeah.

760
01:38:22,234 --> 01:38:28,274
After a brief adjustment period,
and a bunch of drinks..

761
01:38:29,364 --> 01:38:31,364
It's a face...

762
01:38:37,314 --> 01:38:40,334
I'd be happy to sit on.

763
01:38:47,194 --> 01:38:53,544
But I'm not the same underneath
this suit either. Super-penis.

764
01:38:53,844 --> 01:38:57,774
Come on, Wade, language.
Young one is present.

765
01:38:58,784 --> 01:39:02,814
What are you still doing ---- Get
outta here, go make yourself useful.

766
01:39:02,914 --> 01:39:07,944
You, go be a really big brother to someone.
Tell Beast to stop shitting on my lawn.

767
01:39:08,054 --> 01:39:13,794
And you, chicken noodle. Nothing
Compares 2 U. Sinead O'Connor, 1990. Sorry.

768
01:39:13,894 --> 01:39:19,934
- That's all right. You're cool.
- What in the ass?

769
01:39:20,034 --> 01:39:26,994
- That was not mean! I'm proud of you!
- We will make an X-Man of you yet, Wade.

770
01:39:27,094 --> 01:39:33,034
You know, for a second there, it felt like we were 3 mini
lion robots coming together to form one super robot.

771
01:39:33,084 --> 01:39:35,784
- This was stupid.
- Yeah.

772
01:39:38,694 --> 01:39:43,534
And now, for the moment
I've all been waiting for.

773
01:39:46,434 --> 01:39:48,374
Come here.

774
01:39:57,084 --> 01:40:00,964
WHAM! As promised.

775
01:40:12,584 --> 01:40:16,454
See? You don't need to be
a superhero to get the girl.

776
01:40:17,424 --> 01:40:20,324
The right girl will bring
out the hero in you.

777
01:40:20,424 --> 01:40:28,364
Now, let's finish this epic wide shot, pull out, here we go...
Looks nice, not gonna be the only thing that's pulling out tonight.

778
01:40:28,454 --> 01:40:35,354
Who doesn't love a happy ending, huh? Until next
time, this is your friendly neighborhood Pool guy singing...

779
01:42:33,264 --> 01:42:35,234
You're still here.

780
01:42:37,214 --> 01:42:40,464
It's over! Go home!

781
01:42:41,694 --> 01:42:46,674
Oh, you're expecting a teaser for Deadpool 2.
Well, we don't have that kind of money.

782
01:42:46,874 --> 01:42:54,954
What were you expecting, Sam Jackson'll
show up?  Eye patch? Saucy leather? Go, go.

783
01:42:59,294 --> 01:43:02,834
Oh! But I can tell you one thing
and it's a bit of a secret.

784
01:43:02,834 --> 01:43:09,734
In the sequel, we're gonna have Cable. Amazing character.
Bionic arm, time-travel. We have no idea who to cast yet,

785
01:43:09,834 --> 01:43:12,304
but it could be anybody. Just
take a big guy with a flat top.

786
01:43:12,404 --> 01:43:18,614
Could be Mel Gibson, Dolph Lundgren, Keira Knightley.
She's got range, who knows? Anyway, big secret.

787
01:43:18,804 --> 01:43:24,134
And don't leave your garbage rotting
around. It's a total dick move. Go.
